you're developing your imagination
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
it's kind of rainy actually

absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up three times
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you cut the pie
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i lived out in the country

i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the armed forces did so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will

we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not counting on it

she'll be two in july
i just flat didn't spend any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
he has used a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote

what's going to happen
i only weigh sixteen today
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any living relatives

i enjoy them coming
but it has a pretty low crime rate
big closet space
they're welcome to go some place else
i write software
we do a lot of things on the weekends together

well we just started
we started taking her
my mother and i were
we are so busy
i'd like to go bird hunting
sometimes you have to ask them for that
then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad checks
do you watch star trek
no you don't have to put it down
i don't see much tv mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and say
i don't get too many of those
did they do that before you went in or what
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period
of course it's real convenient
my husband and i both went
you learn more about the characters and stuff
just a little shell to go under a suit
then we put our receipts in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers per gallon
they'd seen it earlier
it shouldn't be destroyed
chemical services to come
which i thought was a real interesting question
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's still not enough for a total
one thing led to another
two different parts of the country
i really don't have any job benefits to speak of
it really helps those people
put a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for you in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did
they think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i don't know how my father did it
lived on a farm for sixty years
i look at homemaking as a job also
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
clothing and gas
the commercial districts
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
savings and loans
they plastered over drywall
i'll slice white grape
the bomb development
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how she got it
your tuition reimbursement
getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts
if you have any doubts whatsoever
mystery movies
i can't remember where
