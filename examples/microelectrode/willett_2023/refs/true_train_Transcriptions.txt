usually this time is a considerable investment
long range financial planning
god's voicemail box
i think there's definite roles
includes the authentic japanese voiceover cast
is there work to support this conclusion
what was it called
red white and blue
that's a big concern if you live there
that's the kind that produces the best
in the garage
generations from now
so i thought that i would put that there
it's a policeman and he's working with the family
but it's slow burning
yes usually
they've come a long way
i was hired into the government
our children are now eleven and nine
it's just the idea

some of the people that i work
we're very far from our families
boy scouts postpone decision on admitting gays
enjoy whenever you desire
well she's going to
we're kind of their pets
we don't do this too often
it depends on which company you work for
it's just the old guys still there
that's my boy you made my day
it was entertaining
when do you touch them
i miss the intellectual stimulation
comment made by television pioneer philp
he gets home from work late
make vector versions of the bottlenecks
and it will come in on the next one
closures and job losses
two points are being indicated
they enjoyed that
that's why i enjoy going to restaurants
you get the point
he's never gone away
the scent contains poisonous plant extract
they don't drive them that much
they're trying to get more people into that field
most of the health clubs are all men
some people prey on that
conclusion and final words
where i go to church now
we 'd never done it so well
what do you like to do this time of year
you will see them in management
i really like that show
which field do you work in
so i would probably purchase another one
an allusion
they blow the whistle on each other
home with two children
i am used to it now
we moved to texas before that happened
it's all got to line up
we had the same type of situation
that's good size
all the money comes from house cleaning
i'm kind of learning this
what limits ought to be put on it
how many horses and on what occasion
but i don't like to make it
she kept in touch like that
they 'll probably be pretty good
if i can't afford to have some kind of vacation
how old are your boys
not be able to be in her apartment on her own
cars have come down in price significantly
what are you guys having for christmas dinner
i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory
and we have three playing baseball
and this other girl was not joyful
it seems like that's the case
not measuring inflation properly
final version
hope you enjoy this piece
it was the last time they went up
she's right at a year and we finally got her
as well as the public
you moved here from california
good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
it's interesting that we're spoiled
posh british accent in her voice
and he decided to choose joy
insulation in those things
i like most of them except for country music
my parents still live there
have you ever tried a one iron
i guess we're kind of fortunate
that's the way it's going to be
and my insurance is about to expire
this is my eleventh year
there is a down side to all this
you and i are tested for the virus
is that quality time
i guess we weren't going
we moved from colorado
i guess they would be mad
i had never been out of choices
and i'm not sure what it is
i haven't been able to catch any of that
that much of a difference
it seems to be not difficult enough for students
they all clapped as he jogged out to join them
you think you 'd know better
it's so darned easy to turn the thing on
one of the past styles
they do a lot of low key shows
usually it snaps back into place by morning
we leave three little piles
i got to go find a job
your role and experience
i used to be really hooked on all my children
first real job after getting my degree
my kids go to school in another suburb
i found that they've been fun for my little girls
trying to repair our own cars
i get up just barely in time to make the bus
you know meatless meals
after that they will be destroyed
you're more willing to go in and try
i think a lot of choices
as far as that goes i'm not sure
it's more or less a spare room
based on what you've seen
he was not the star
yeah i know that it's a real problem
the luxury travel
how to pinpoint to the lucky days
the preparation time was so long
i would prefer to have in home care
i have stuck to water aerobics
they're much better students at twenty five
they could actually combine the early ones
you don't have to but they did anyway
meet my pleasure
we all like my oldest brother
he took more of an interest later
i think it's a really big problem
basic supportive measures airway protection
you probably wear coats a lot
there're three pulleys that you change
very reluctantly
we were going up to a larger one
it makes my life and my work a lot easier
it was cute but not the biggest laugh i've seen
build and deploy manually
she works in these fields
the glass windows are dirty
they had it everywhere
multiple versions
meeting conclusion
vegetables grow in the fields
and they try to hook you into his organization
we didn't have anyone in town that was our family
now have you thought about this
they would shut down to retool
we don't have as many trees
wall occasionally runs laps
and money is their main goal
the classical thing that you see on tv
that's what they say
you know something must be wrong
it had held onto a small portion
she's just like him
but we don't like to do that at all
at least one of your machines
i guess football is the big sport down here
i've been back up for a reunion
drug rehabilitation
yet the delusion persists
we are on a farm
they have donated it to charities
point by point summary
i had had everyone in my department recycling
there's a lot of places to take pictures
i will have to stop in there
that's avoidable
it has a big engine
chips and salsa and peanuts
and i think most of them have agreed to that now
they got real fat
the choice this november is tragic
i really hope she does well
i don't know how hard it is
you hear the same
even in the country
good social interaction
mechanical engineer
i think i know a little more than i use to
you like food and i just love the smell
we don't currently do this service
that seems to be our biggest problem down here
i also like jazz
my stepfather's from england
not because i haven't got the desire
the only purpose for handguns is to shoot people
you can't spend it either
it was never very intuitive to me
you get a good job and you work until you retire
there was not nearly as much of it
but mine was freeze
sometimes i 'll listen to jazz in the background
i have opinions about it
no i have never organized one
my little girl goes to tap dance
or in terms of their opinions
i don't know what that's about
it's actually the first car we ever bought new
any latest version of linux
good decision so far
trying to produce some new programs
how strong the maternal instinct is going to be
i went back to school and got my master's
original oil on oval canvas painting
everything i learned about ancient rome
i'm really thinking a lot about this
i drove a cab when i was a graduate student
the full story behind visual conflict rendering
it's the one that everybody wants
i really wanted to go on the rafting trip
that's one way to do it
lots of familiar noises returned as i set off
i do not think a lot of parents enjoy
sesame street will do
how do you feel about women in tech
i'm kind of leaning towards not going
i don't know many of those people
the thing to do is to try to park one street over
i understand when they pulled the troops
out near my house is pretty hilly
you can come and go as you please
i really hate service jobs
the steamed shellfish you said was good
let your voice be heard

there is a competition all the time
vision testing
invasion in iraq
fluorescent colors
this guy's fixing to do something
such things as extremely good school systems
and it's late at night
i have done some bow hunting
just forty miles north
this is easy for me
they almost look neon
the islanders sleep inside
it was an interesting experience
it was prime time
beard oil for men
and i edge it occasionally
at least their daddy goes with them
have you been able to do that all along
i just realized it's not going to happen
we try to stay within a certain budget
i hope i'm on the right track
my brother lives where i work
i used drugs last week
i started at one edge and went over
original german version here
you get into a house
doesn't seem quite fair
and he bit into it
they are able to reduce prices
i don't know what your percent is on your phone
allowable uses and disclosures
i don't know where the answer is
stones with runes on them served as checkpoints
i've not really had that many problems with it
it's very disappointing
he ate a piece of the pie
i think it's important
has such a high clay content
they don't take kid into kindergarten
good luck on your graduation
maybe you would enjoy it
spent a day and a lot of money
and i think he's guilty as the devil
and since the slips all look alike
it would have been okay
the kids cried when i took them
you really can count thousands of stars
with a bunch of people
the money's not available
that was a tragic experience for us too
how did you join the fight
the supreme court
it ain't as bad this time
run into the gas station
they left him alone
it's like a swamp
some of the young men and women
they don't think anything of that
just being excellent
talking in a beat
there was too many children per person
this is really a stupid thing that happened
try not to use any insecticides at all
join the facebook fan page
they just moved into the new building
a big metropolitan area
what is that restaurant
you might want to attack
i was really shocked
nice house and all that
it's really nice to go and see them
they have already explored the entire house
i work part time and just get paid hourly
that's one of the biggest ones i've seen
the players usually vote
they're doing good tonight
but now i realize that it was better
zoology department
i think that is a very wrong way to handle
voting will make a difference
they just watched the water pour in on the carpet
it has really reached the point of absurdity
have you been to any lately
bacon and all that good stuff
it's high canyon
and it wasn't
collisions should never happen
envision a life you love
you have to kind of wait for it
i have certain things that i take
i 'll be there afternoons
not too long ago
i guess with the daughter he's all right
try a slice through a hook here
first off we 'd probably wind up with a dud
mostly we catch carp
at least they all seem to have fun
the paint wasn't going on right
my father is in the corduroy jacket
you can eat a whole big plate of their food
always include help and version commands
we weren't all out to be teachers
i can't really remember what it is
you saw a fair number of troubled kids
others said they were disappointed
has seem to relocated down that area
and i don't like that so i don't do that
and they took infants starting at six weeks
weren't there a lot of hurricanes there
i don't know how people do it with one
that makes me feel a little better of course
it's not anything like kansas
i sit and study
it's the reason i get annoyed
that way you can enjoy the game
no they don't want you on the jury
there's always this feeling of hope
how did you get on it
anaesthesia directors
let's take the example
security measures
don't travel too much
she's lived with us for like five years
she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have
that's my husband mark
in miles per hour and some are in kilometers
right now we don't have anything
my kind of camping
hope you all enjoy this
take a stash of books or small quiet toys
i might find a job that has flexible hours
do you know if virginia has it
a really nice place
learn about version control
the library has a journal section
vitamin a is essential for vision
that's interesting you say that
they had no choice
i've never itemized it
he went to the bathroom in the pavillion
i guess the weather will be warm
i do like having them there
they are so much greater now
this could be the tipping point for bolt
there would have to be some kind of note
she does have a job and a career
i don't even really know who she is
and that is the best book to go through
no immediate reports of casualties
that's a real waste too
you're not supposed to have that
i caught the end of that
and they try to solve them and everything
mom was always prepared and she'd bring it along
it's well worth it
ground invasion
thirty years ago
fifty cents a day
in the chambers
rent it when it comes out for my husband to see
do about fifteen miles a week
this is the way it's going to be and it was bad
it was a real rarity
start by concentrating and increasing your visualization power
they have such a super team for years
find somebody in that situation
it's almost four years old
i've pressed the button
more on their level
do you have kids
they are at this point true victims
enjoyable to use
thank you boys for bringing joy into my heart
yeah that's an idea
they're moving to florida
they went bankrupt
carlos has big decisions to make
i want to make some flower beds
don't spend over that
we grew up in the south
i avoided him
the businesses around in that area
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry
half dozen coats
we have a list is that what you mean
that is a consequence
a decision was expected friday
i got a double major
the graying of america
born on the fourth of july
the teachers expect it
and all of a sudden
a lot of older folks need help getting down stairs
i think they get a lot of people in trouble
store associates will get two weeks of pay after the closure
we shouldn't have a lot of this junk mail
i guess i like a variety of things
they don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves
we do discuss a great deal
they do everything well
you could pretty well guess where it was
emergency care
and we like movies
moved into the apartment and got cable
two baths duplex
i have a jig saw and a scroll saw
in our household
and the first one
i don't want these people around
why do you do this
that's pretty wild
we buy cassette tapes
it's getting to be more and more like a mac
it's the best show on that channel
half what it cost to buy
my wife and i both like it
that's kind of the same thing for me
i've never been there for dinner
and i'm sure i'll be like that
i think the service charge is pretty low
they moved it from tuesday night to wednesday night
spoiler alert
and it cost me twenty five dollars
it was just so much cooking
how big do they get
i don't know it's maybe five percent
not for the money that i was going to spend
i do have a personal computer on my desk here
watch it in high resolution and enjoy
i can see why people wouldn't want that
hey've amazed me to get to this point
an unjust amount of time
it's been fun talking to you
living in arizona
did you catch the christmas spirit yet
my older boy's real happy
who's the running guy
i mean it was kind of like it
it was boneless and we tried it
they might work on that
so she was there pretty much all my life
i remember there was a time
forty five dollars a year
summary points
that whole space issue
if you're willing to work for it
just lucky to have jobs
i don't think they know
new platform versions
i heard about it though
i only work part time
i mean when we moved in
so i think that's been important
adjust to these changes as they come about
it's a loaded cannon
it would be nice if they could get them together
some of them are so joyful
those are two very active ages
i haven't thought about that
fifteen miles away from work
and i just ended up having to drop the class
you can't count on that measure
those were big political events
i think that's a really good thing to encourage
it doesn't sound necessary in texas
somebody's getting antsy
brilliant deductor
weight training and seizure prevention
in the middle of a residential area
you will be doing lots of stuff
there really needs to be a bridge
it was a point of honour with us not to whine
guys and gals whatever they are
so you're doing it yourself
they're going to get mad
the tree were so poignant
realistically it is
i played for the choral club in high school
we will appeal this decision
we will consider your point of view
they're building a house into the side of a hill
we've got a two year old son
did you get the message
void eater
i bet you that's an experience there
when you're traveling
even if i have my dog with me
much of asia shows the opposite
it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere
i think there's still choice
and if i am looking for entertainment usually i go out
he ate right when he got home from atlanta
but it's along the lines
does your wife work
it would be fun just to win one
we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere
some boilerplate
avoiding default
measuring milk in a more lightweight
is that why you picked the school you did
an hour and a half away
seeing their natures as equally void
one engineer said it was really an education
some time in the spring
i can't really say that we have hobbies
but that wasn't too bad on tearjerker
everyone concerned
i guess i got my money's worth
we really enjoy that too
avoid toxic relations
and his employees agree
and it was really oriented toward little kids
there's somebody different
i think it's like one or the other
it's easy to tweak your version
i walked in the door
we destroyed them right there
have you ever been to hawaii
i read a lot of non fiction books
canned baked beans
that was how it was in virginia
i have nothing to say about this
the people who have the most
beware of spoiler content
woodworking mastery
that is what i am afraid of
she really didn't know how to handle herself
my husband always says he earns it
i just do not call on the phone
there's one juror that is late
i'm really enjoying it
pass the inspection
she must really like them
i'd want a minivan
an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
i was paying for it myself
you can always blame it on having children
that makes sense too
that's very hard to do
because they don't want to know
it's a joy to behold
we enjoy doing it
it's on wheels and it's big
outrageously priced
i guess it's close enough
i've got two babies
there's this one actor everyone likes
but my boss wouldn't pay for it
there's just my husband and i
the people are really nice
and then when they young
it's a brand new one
a type of work station
go to the bike shop and pick it up
he can walk and he's six foot

double utilities
i could fix every car in the world
when i do recipes i just throw stuff in
they had his birth recorded
she's the little girl
what about the judge who's hearing the case
a driving force in that decision
they see that we spend a lot of time together
it doesn't seem like very many people went
we never had any in the house
parking garage
here are the choicest excerpts from the draft
you threw this away
you buy the canned baked beans
it's for homosexuals and gays
that is just as valuable
our sleeping bags i guess
you've given me purpose joy and hope
needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
since we've been married i've stopped going
not in terms of north and south
there's a subtitle to it
you allow yourself to enjoy every step you take
that's really neat
i've never actually seen her in concert
i have three left living at home
a very extended family
hyperinflation would destroy the system
she's quite familiar with how it is up there
we got a penny a pound for them
video game stuff
in may it will be five years since i've known him

now we quit that about two years ago
and we didn't know the difference
royal palm
and i don't need their fill ins
at times she enjoys it
some classical music
i guess i'll get back to my laundry
you can buy whatever you want
my daughter's in love with the little mermaid
usually she uses her left hand
that's not the worse thing that we've seen happening
which one is the tourist area
but it seems to me that the boy is dull
there was a company in houston
animal sales are much higher than usual
well maybe i'll get you next time
do you have a wok though
usually anybody that comes over notices
while i was raised in a big family
i figured the choice is mine
the concern about it was overblown
stuff led to an explosion
i don't have to concentrate too hard on them
through television
which kindergarten are they going to get into
they made her feel like the criminal
when i was making my decision
they'll check for alcohol
i have always loved reading
i'm sitting here in my forty year old house
we'd want something kind of unique
because we never went to war
i stopped payment on a check
she heard another noise coming from the gym
air pollution is harmful
a perpetual problem
i'm in facilities and happen to have the key with me
i've never had a budget
then it has little rooms off of it
several asian countries
lumping us all together as asian american
i mean they're not helping anybody
i really loved it
accumulate the coins and extract profit
people are afraid to fly now
my parents used to have dogs
that would have been something
they're good both ways
if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what
or towns to come in and dump their trash there
i don't have that problem
i'm real busy with my kids in sports right now
i wear lots of shorts
i think the line item veto is not
the decision to increase the number of assistants
i think it would work out well
yet the delusion persists
you could read well at five years old
we're in a relatively new area
doesn't mean that any decisions have been made
zipper closure
all of the innovation is on android right now
i went back to work
that would be devastating i'm sure
hemp provisions
it's written at a third grade level
he really enjoys it
i have to admit that i am afraid
i mean i don't even know where to start
what would you make
you create a bigger surprise
really superb even though it was a public school
really interested in things like that
i guess ridiculous to let them keep building
i am in falls church
i hope someday you'll join us
in terms of psychological impact it's big
eat slowly chew every bit and enjoy the meal
you did really quite well
i think maybe you look at it
a great addition
you know if i had to put someone in there it wouldn't be him
he reflected on his current choice
it's a shame
i was accused of selling it
i never made one for myself though
so it all comes filtering down to us all
create a sports division

it all centers around your toxic thyroid gland
why are our prisons overcrowded
we don't have inspections like that
she said in blake's voice
that pleased me
apartment or a home
they're usually a pretty good bet
enjoy the adventure
i'm here at the university
the moderate choice
that's not helpful
my husband says that's called rinky dink
it really makes it easier
all of his children live in the dallas area too
the sequence was altered for the international versions
our values of diversity and inclusion
the decision will move back down
they would have had kids running around by then
one of the things they talked about was money
teach her to write her name
that's a good choice
you can actually see it
i've seen some of them on repeat
tell me where that is
i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be
what would you have them do
we both came out of our shells
one year public service for everybody
it just takes a very long time
north korea is still allowed to receive oil

it never did appeal to me simply because it was long
joining mining pool
please join a different team
i'm already home for the day
dementia along with confusion can be a part of every day life
only employees are allowed to pick up the cats

it avoided sudden change
looking at visions of the future
on occasion one of these ants is infected
it doesn't all have to be white
did more responsibility help
i worked at a steel mill
we had to give him a tomato
you can get out there and toy with them
more choice more cccountability
i believe those of us who were working down there
coconut oil as a home remedy
in a big company you can do anything
you just really can't tell what's going to happen
at this point i'm too afraid to ask andy

i know for sure
the decision has been made that a change is now necessary
street boys
i think he's the only one
it is bad everywhere except for vietnam
the drug agency didn't want it
i've never served on the jury
how easy it is to blow money you earn
almost a hundred percent
and tell your wife i hope we meet again soon
my parents are now in san diego
in his league do they have a pitcher
they rebuilt that school a year ago
he died in a holy cause
up in new england where i'm from
but also while i was growing up
isn't she fabulous
but he was with another company before that
what they usually do is too slow
every time she sees something she startles
everything isn't always somebody else's fault
do you just mix it to taste
on the computer network
and other child that they'd already had
i'll stop eating
around where i live
we try to put those in the warehouse
i put in pepper plants this weekend
they should just all be shot right now
i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
what you're doing is illegal
that is true in illinois and across this nation
they bought their home in the suburbs
it just happened a couple of weeks ago
you're a mormon then
crime always increases
they're really kind of fascinating
it isn't real wise
knowing your choices
that's a good way to go too
more careful measurements
always see guns in there
i thought that was a pretty good movie
so i can live without you
susan is annoying
because there're many italians in argentina
and she starts her own stuff from seed now
i'm trying to think what the purdue kids watch
i've heard so many people talk about that area
so i'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot
to the heart of the matter though
we lived here before the war
it's funny how many names have been used
to be active and everything in school
both of the children were in college
it starts hitting closer to home
we don't start anything indoors
what can i hide and what do i have to tell
shish kabob
this sort of thing
but the licenses weren't that expensive
but i guess people do that when they're desperate
rub the chops liberally with the olive oil
we had a dog that was adorable
it's too much trouble
but it's the only choice
audience choice award
that there was absolutely true
to work or trying to take care of your own family
that's good
i think that could work as a toy
i don't think i'm a real true believer
that's a waste of my time
and a lot of people talk about
nick has great vision
two parent families
a lot of times i eat while i'm thinking
the one that they have
a lot of things
i would have maybe called sooner if i had known
and our city will pick up our recyclables
make uniforms for the kids
my dad's got a new bike
a disappointing result
the continentals can offer a lot
that could have alleviated a big problem
it's been so long since we've been to the movies
enjoy your day
i had a nineteen seventy eight version before this one
some flights were diverted during the closure
measured by its liquid weight
there's no doubt whatsoever
if you want to go on a boat alone be careful
might as well buy me a new car for that
occasionally scary
where we went from there
what are you talking about
i'm a traveling salesman
i called the minute the sun went down
i keep waiting for it to die
i haven't tried before
in that position on the board
and if they don't ever see it how can they know
that's what my mother does for leisure
self determination
i've lived in my home for thirty years
look at each other
what do we recycle
i think they test four or five a day
he's out of daycare

it's like shrimp on the gulf
when you were pregnant
in the mountains
owning on them and making payments on them
i haven't started making money yet
when you pull it up
there's a general illness that needs to be healed
and that's happened to me more than once or twice
like entertainment tonight i've never seen mtv
i mean we're talking
the last two years
and you paint around it
new home situation
had an upstairs apartment
it was expensive
in addition to an individual's rights
or something with crayons
and dogs take a lot of time
we beat buffalo
what's his whim to decide it should be two months
it is a beautiful country
it's four bedrooms and two baths
i just grew up in oklahoma
which is outside of dallas
can't give up on it
like the fifties oldies
it went off pretty much without a hitch
i've got three card offers now
and look forward to retirement maybe
assign my wife that chore
well do you know something
she doesn't think she could be a mother at home
several magazines like that a few years ago
and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend
as what they're doing
seventy percent of the people said
very low mileage on it
for this time of year
he fell back several years ago
and that's about it
i think they could
never been real thrilled
you have to earn a right
austin is so pretty
some guy that was attacking women jogging
and that i couldn't watch
then pay it at the end of the month
i think i am going crazy trying to do it
that should just simply be taken out of the homes
the utilities are pretty much
i'll look for it
i think that's part of the role reversal
which again a lot of people who are motivated
i like the way that
so do you go to college right now
so hopefully our budget will in increase
i'm not for sure we know exactly
the first appeal is automatic
we did it last time
i guess he's leaving
about a tablespoon of sugar
and i had periods when i didn't do anything
he has all that and with his doctors and stuff
we don't have cable
or was it roosevelt
in the winter time there was no smell at all
and we just had a regular old typewriter
and then he came out with the invisible touch
it doesn't seem that long
i get my news from a combination of sources
and once they get somebody good
this is the first time i've done it
i just got over the flu
we just moved in in september
but i have two cats
somehow that just seems weird to me
i mean i'm driving a piece of junk
the character is trying
don't know if this is an advantage or disadvantage
they take a notion to do it
a parent should tell their child
i just get with another friend
when i think of drug testing
oh if you have your health
the minute i said the word
and pretend like he's playing games you know
the system right now
because it's her business and everything
if i've got time
you don't blame that
i've got one that's seven and one that's three
she works with him
salad with cucbers
and they don't learn the communications
and believe me you'll know the difference
you know what i would love
so that was upsetting
that they can't do as good a job
more of them doing men's fields
i should be able to do things like this
i have preferences
it's not really like this
when they have teachers' holidays
i don't think i've heard anything on the rangers
about how many calls have you made on this system
three strikes against them when they're out there
and we went out to dinner with some friends
they live in alabama
and they were not really fighting
a really important thing to me is when they would come
had a living room
and so they just fit in there
last christmastime
that's a nightmare
we had such an economic slowdown
this one that you raised
i guess that i really don't know that much
he's not that old
i'm hoping that we can work something out here
it's just hysterical
i see at least two a week
and it also helps when they were winning
there are plenty of good people
the internal problems
the whole electronic classroom idea
then maybe there is no hope
they get taken up at the store
you utilize all of it
i do play the piano
and live happy lives
a little trinket for each day
i've done that for college football
we do some projects every now and then
i've heard that she's done real cool things
about twenty years ago
that's a whole new field in itself
he's been a legend for so many years
is there a basis for it
provide medicine to their family mens
or if you haven't sold property
i had my school do it
just something fun to do
they're in there
a circuit court judge
if william kennedy smith had been found guilty
would you consider
but that's not really exactly immigration
forms for things
and so i've seen a variety of types of benefits
it's real little
very scary to see what they found out
and no matter where you build it
i decided it is not worth it
i mean the kids can be a real pest
violence oriented
be settled anywhere
i sit and design cards
we hadn't did it ourselves
is it worse than smoking
the more people offer them to you
so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books
and that kind of thing
doesn't seem so far
with the smoking premis
well that's kind of good to know
a lot of different comedies
you just think to yourself
any experiences you've had at work
it was just terrible
i don't have to worry a whole lot about that
oh that's a big thrill for them
then i finally made it to england
those are all great
but i was thinking
since that's all they do is news to dig deeper
maybe we'll talk again
had an impact on the society around here
i mean it's not going to be overnight
i really have not seen them
they could sell five
you can always heat it up again
it's kind of a concern for me
that is pretty good
i knit sometimes
they don't get to see their grandkids
i listen to like ninety seven point one
the weeds that come up in between the bricks
i think not normal setting
i have to watch cartoons on saturday morning
you have a lot of experience as far as i know
low stress exercise
my answer is no thank you
they refuse to give him more salary
there's both sides to it too
there's minimum wage jobs
they're just so suspenseful
maybe it was november i'm thinking about
they're not going to voluntarily say
i don't read a lot of nonfiction
the one they have taken
it was basically
or does it have to
you don't have to be an expert to play
you couldn't really talk
it sounds like it's good
i was really surprised
foundation planning
or evaluate a person by that
i still live in san jose
twelve hours away
nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once
maybe eighteen inches
i hope you can find it
nothing comparable
they're all former lawyers
one of the reasons
i'd respond probably by biting or something
and then i worked for dragon systems for a while
i guess my concern is what we are reading
it's hard to follow
it went the other way
and she won't even think about it
and put it in front of the wal mart store in town
it's a eighty eight
i was just one of those
i read in the paper this week
i thought a great deal of it
i've never bought a new vehicle in my life
don't get to play except on the weekend
i'm in upstate new york
you know that this is what is going to happen
more than one at a time
a real good dog
i think you got it
now i remember it
and the skunk was a good story
these little small cities
letters of applications to universities
that's all they got right now
any type of emotional
what do you think about the movie
parents and children
and i had gotten home shortly before that
they try to throw in good stuff
just get hysterical
but he's been kind of up and down all year
my mother likes to serve taco grandes
particularly if they have children
she's an indoor dog most of the time
you saw the passage of the civil rights act
gone are the days of those things they use
there was very little external communications
that's exactly how they do it
it comes on again
it's aking profits
don't seem like they are doing much with it
it's individual basis
there's no possible way that you could do it
don't like it really
on a full time basis here in town
how to get a job
i really would be at a loss
so i'd like to wipe them all out
tendency not toil makes fame
other people are poor
that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
why can't trees break down
there wasn't anything for
soccer is destroying the usa
so he kind of was a cowboy type
it kind of does get to be a routine
read more about deploying node
they just drop it in
if you do have to go sometime
ranking points
barbecues and mexican food
because i didn't decide to major in that until a few years later
just more facts would be nice
we just don't protect them
i think we have a lousy school system
his social security number
then his sixteen year old brother started helping
because it actually doesn't matter who shows up
you have to prepare the fire
drunk drivers kill people
it's such a joy
give an incentive
what are you hoping for
there's several
a counselor and a therapist
and we said to them
i used oil base paints for trim
i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty or so
one of the biggest things in the animal kingdom
i suspect that it is possible
there's something about having a place to live
the comparison is almost expected at this point
a shadow of a doubt
but as far as the aftermath
you shouldn't have left it there
i know if i didn't have that stipulation
buy a toilet plunger
i don't know if you follow shows
television stations showed a more complex story
braised hard boiled egg
she's met them already
you don't need a personal one
i wonder where they do that
or is it all funded out of local taxes
this is my dad's part
to know what to expect really
were you introduced
the college ranks
in this way every decision you make must be carefully considered
i think it's interesting
a clear division arose
the settlement however avoids a trial
that's a good way to get started
i don't know about ninety
it is easier to do when i do some chores
we lived up north long enough to appreciate the cold
they had people who did the yard
usually a company
it was car races after horse races
i agree with you
i avoid foreign companies
it's usually before the ceremony
they're out of korea right
that's an interesting one
her voice quavered
i sew clothes for them every once in a while
you're just drawn into his charm
if i find a good book
my wife and daughter were kidnapped
the judicial mishap in this event
they think they're getting ahead
choice of black or white
boy groups usually learn from foreign choreographers
terrorist attacks and national security
now i see you again on this soil
shower and dress
i can't necessarily blame them
take the extra measures for security
they've really become very much involved
i like pierce anthony
how they're going to feel about it
fused coins are free coins
i didn't want to have kids
they trade the nucleus of their power right now
i would say i've never been
losers all the way around
it's not the times
but the point was apparent
i talk to my husband
she wanted them to call boyd to get one for her
exploitation of the african continent
it was a bittersweet joy
whatever they tell you
you order a meal
i mean it's dying now
very practical stuff
if they do come back next year
trying to join an existing organization
he's a proponent of that
as far as doing things for them
how many of those damn coins will we need
i was in english as a matter of fact
mike was the gunner of the convoy
you're going to get it
i think they should
there's a little sensing device
it might not be brand new but it was a decent car
they have their own budget they go by
basic voter rolls are fully exploited data sets
composer section
i bought a stationary bike
i barely made it through high school
we live close to dallas
they still found him guilty
you are what kind of buff
they just get around town
is there anything
a lot of jurors
luxury hotels that you can't afford to miss
i do not see that they should stop her
her mother was very old
the city manager
this exposure might draw us all to reflection
we got pizza delivered to our house
they're real active in volunteer work
there's quite a waiting list to get into that
i get most of my news from the paper
the room was full of rugby league royalty
get rid of the two that we have right now
on the other hand
in conclusion this is a great skill to have
virginia is not a particularly rich state
i noticed that his voice trembled
we do have a nice retirement package
this is like judo on steroids
i have a dog also
far too much for what we get
professors from other schools
we would make that sacrifice
helping him locate the toys on the list
that's what i use all the time
it's not that big of a deal
they're very vocal
some of the seeds got dropped
we set up a budget
remember those three points above
they just went from generation
i think going six weeks makes sense
we generally order pizza in
which i was kind of leaning toward anyway
as i watched he was joined by two young people
what is the current state of the early access version
places usually that i wouldn't be going
people will kind of set up their own little club
while i am coiling the ropes
she already expected the decision
the latest android phones for less
i like that they run tense
i haven't gotten through it yet
you know what i am saying
i really think that money's history
in fact my mom's out there in texas right now
a lightning version
i think there's so much prejudice still there
they had a lady come in
the homeowner can't be touched
but again you know that's not the treasury's call
what should i do
oiling the economy
you don't like to
i use them both here at work and at home
we don't have any snow here now
as far as something to eat
punishing point
my scalp will start to bleed
picking up dirt
that's the key there
you guys sure want to be out of range
the public's split on it
there's just no one around
that's what i hope
this thing that i'm doing
there is no real counter measurement
we didn't do anything
i won't tell you that
the whales usually weigh about seven tonnes
how they work is fascinating to me
i had a dump truck come and dump it
i'm doing all right
the way kids are talking these days
that's possible i guess
you hear the news
she really enjoyed life
it's probably costing you a fortune
treat the same with due remedial measure promptly
we see them at least once a week
that's what's happening here
we don't get reimbursed
join the discussion
he took care of it
we eat breakfast sometimes
he's going to be traveling to europe with a choral group
i'm in the navy
albus favored the boy with a fond look
i watch mysteries too
there was one point i was going to make
where a head gasket bolt broke
there has also been a diversion of inventory to the black market
instead of taking them up there
no matter how annoying it gets
and they're very dedicated to that
a few seconds ago an illusion
excellent acting by billy crystal
a salesperson will usually want to know
you know it wasn't just a super bad storm
have you painted anything recently
watch and then record over it
beans like to be near certain types of plants
i'm going to vote each time
doing serious journalism in indonesia
it'll help in some way
chuck norris
i guess if we get a new car
each boy in the hostel was rich in experience
will you be getting these toys come october
separate into lights and darks
it's an eighty seven degree day
once you get your masters
might make a good salad
labour staff are stupidly loyal
then i was very disappointed
what some of these people really went through
the senate's choice should be to say no
just a moment okay nancy
if they penalize businesses
you don't need to put that down there
not a huge part
my husband has time off next month
the first is an asteroid
especially with the kids
everything's really expensive here
i think it is too
they shouldn't have a family
why start it at that point
were you trying to follow any type of rule
court cases are about justice
you know one of the top three in the state
the benefits weren't there
it just takes a long time to get it done
the browning bar is a good choice here
you just sit down on on the deck
an individual ferret thing
have you fly fished
they're very dissatisfied
now he's in rhode island
he threw up in the kitty litter
i think there's about seventy
we play board games
i also remember an illustrated version of this story
i mean it's a very good movie
russell ultimately married his boyfriend
texas leads the nation in uninsured children
a modified version
easy feedback for my visual novel
it wasn't that big of a family
takes an awful lot of time
actually listening to the news
have some part of the law
they didn't ask adam to join
search for attitudes and whatnot
live in such lavish style
i guess that would be good
what happened to it
i'm at a little bit of a loss
i was thinking it'll be okay
the remaining teams will compete in the premier division
we always seem to
understanding those folks
because it's industry
something really minor
maybe that will make people think a bit more
i mostly listen to popular music
i would like to be able to do that
she thought it was riveting
i had that almost similar situation
thank you for enjoying this regardless
it is about twelve hours drive
what's the word i'm looking for
when i was younger we'd go every weekend
i'd wonder what is that
you just put it in the oven
and i guess maybe that's the way it is
i don't keep up on it and i don't feel like i miss much
see if they could
i am very much for capital punishment
i guess they must be finished
and i think that is healthy
i didn't make the jury
she'll buy a lot of it
i started a project
if you want to go back to school
add appointments to your calendar
they started out really bad
easier than chicken dinner
tale of two exploits
we usually order our tickets way in advance
even in my own experience
but it is occasionally recorded in much larger animals
a midnight surprise and lots of joy
are you having any trouble with bugs in your garden
it was up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago
my real concern
i don't make anything
what's that state north of us
and there still hasn't been any sign of rain
the boy's father suffered similarly
they were all completely clean
i do not think it's done by now
you can meet some really neat people
certain standards of living
that's what i keep telling this person
it's been a few years
within the last couple of years
not lose their jobs
you can see exactly
upcoming initial coin offerings
i have some neighbors across the field
my family is from kentucky
what looked like a fight
the measure was rejected by supporters because it wasn't broad enough
the rocky mountains are so pretty
i think it was probably a no
my parents did it
they're cutting some of that
another thing
at the rate it's emitted it's being destroyed
before you realize anything is going on
point and click
snapped to attention like a toy soldier
why should a woman be forced to be employed
someplace for the children to be
it's usually okay with me
i heard there was some stuff
to ask automakers for more jobs won't work
i keep rationalizing that
glasses
we still owe money
like second jobs that they work in the afternoons
i just got the new issue
but drastic times could call for drastic measures
it is not a reason
i mean what i say
it makes it convenient
another point for exposure therapy
it was hard to accept that
whether it be science fiction or fantasy
he put himself through school basically
just things around the house
i mean i just don't
they also tended to wait slightly longer to make a decision
our financial situations are dire
i'd like to see them back up there again
he's far too much of a gentleman
some nights it's just real cold
the other thing i can think of
avoid contact with eyes
i'm not building any reserves
we do basically the same thing
pepsi cans and whatever
to shoot up in that way
roy wasn't as effective as he had been
it's modern
you recognized this
that's a beautiful state
fellowships at our church
tall trees
not too controversial
i found it hard to deal with
it pertains to my daily life at the present time
once that was accomplished
a lot of chicken and rice
critic's choice
agree with our choice
sanction turkey over the incursion
friend of hers at work
and that's where a lot of aggravation comes from
i'll be done this afternoon
i didn't have time to do that stuff either
what it costs now is ridiculous
i met her when i lived in hawaii
do something to beautify the school property
pretty tough law and order state
this session is about to run out
that's something i've never had to use
it's time consuming
better find a lawyer
then you get money for your cans
i knew right away he shouldn't try to touch the tiger
give people insight and help them make better decisions
they bought what they could afford
he's nine months old
we don't handle them very well
that's one of those little exclusions
they're equal business partners
see if there is anything in there for us
the numbers that are being thrown around
that interest rate is just a killer
there are also these various disclosures
he bought a measuring stick
what's that about
sometimes my husband clogs the toilet
how do you like it
my new shoes will last me longer than that
i went to work as an editor and writer
it was like five or six dollars
i avoided him
i guess we don't really use that many tin cans
i hope someday you'll join us
putting things on the back burner
you never know what they're going to get into
let me guess
i set up my computer manually
but newspaper articles can show what really happened
we just used a latex base
i've actually been in line the whole time
i want to see the nursing home
well i originally come from new york
but i haven't told my husband
i haven't gone out to check yet
it's so far down the road i can't make it
a restaurant that employs minorities
i've driven in one
i would consider where i was buying it
i had really liked turquoise
i don't water them or anything
after that it was the interior stairs and foyer
quarantine measures were not seen as necessary
and that's not going to be good
i guess it wasn't a real good topic for us
i really feel bad for the people i see there
since he goes to nursery school
the commentaries
i just got married last year
like when i lived in washington
but that's how we got into a problem
we have portuguese speakers
she don't even know how
we're just friends
this whole thing
did they have some pretty good special effects
which was about five years ago
i do it every day on a regular basis
but you probably do
well he works for them
being involved in things like this
they are really funny fish
points to note
they're should be more trees
the grand canyon
we have the most loyal people
this brings you no end of joy
the books are outrageous
i don't know if i'm that brave yet
she was always a little bit leery of her
she stopped doing it
crane's personal life is unusual for the ceo of a big corporation
and they really seem wise
and see that's another thing
they really are over
did you enjoy it though
many of those decisions have been overturned by higher courts
i don't have any now
she has everything planned so closely
do you know where
aren't they playing detroit
makes things break easier
deploy the load balancer
that's why i'm glad my wife did too
but they're planning on doing it very soon
i was reading something in the paper

but there's a lot of them out there that haven't moved
i never watched that ever in my entire life
joint application development
it was wrecked three weeks ago
this is the royal road to hell
random drug testing

has he ever been your favorite player
it's kind of hard to explain

there definitely is

my husband is a vietnam veteran
the most obvious occasion is the celebration of a new home
not this past fall but the previous fall
in a little different grade
they have done it many times over
you shamelessly laughed before the convoy
and pay for her too
gulf sea turtle deaths up joining dolphin trend
if you don't mind reading subtitles
i pay for the extra dental plus vision

well i'll be with other people
raspy voice
investigative reporting
raising kids exclusively
if you do it right i think it comes out even
he has been in prison three or four times
it was also clear from a film standpoint
i don't know that place
due to high concentration of deployments
i'd like to see them go too
i don't mess with it
i think most people want to be
the payroll is lower that way
turmoil from below battering from above
everyone knows how to make tuna fish
their money is still being protected
who do they need to trade
i think our five minutes is about up anyhow
they can go back and look at it
that's the first thing i thought of
if you like to cook
they're expensive

and see what you feel is best for you

there was one noise like that
doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it
you were great
you are experienced i would say
twenty nine years ago
because her statement was invalid
that's what we have

the last time we went to the pacific
the sloppy boys
the families do not necessarily want
if they're going to do that to her

what is the vision for the future of this city
however that decision was overturned on appeal
she's gone three mornings
a medical problem
take those subjects
this is one of those things
the freeze just got them
when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming
it was about five hundred pages
that kind of calms him down for the most part
what is the most enjoyable part of your job
feel free to use the color scheme of your choice
it's not an easy decision to make
so it should be an easy decision right
that was kind of fun
you wouldn't know that
you don't have an annual fee there
when they recognize that it's their tax money
they thought it was too much of a bother
the southwest medical center
i think sooner or later
got to see pike's peak
that was the one from california
at this point it's up in the air he said
how did the situation get to this point
when you find the right cookbook
my taxes have gone up
there were no other injuries in the collision
so far no casualties have been reported
i like doing that part
it just flew all over the place
it's very hard to say
it's a pleasure to meet you
it wasn't like prekindergarten
so they'll stop me
that takes a lot of time
it takes forever to get a call through
it weighs less than the line
i wouldn't want to spend more than two nights
translated and edited by voices of ukraine
one day would be sufficient
i've had that happen
there are some smart ones out there
the phase of the moon
a six hundred dollar three piece suit
a lot of companies are
you realize why we were in the middle east
you don't use any credit cards
you're more fun though
she thought long and hard about this decision
i bought it for cheaper
anyway i hope you enjoy it as much as i do
but i think i'd like it
a nursing home or anything
worked in fast food restaurants
when i think of crime
but it's well worth it and everything
i'm going to
somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer
he is also a member of the royal irish academy
it's because you've been there
it's a lot like camping
it's just me in the house
senior citizen's home
how did we get to this point
i see it go anywhere
it was unusual to say the least
if i had a third one
to what do i owe the pleasure of your company
i guess i did not
we will miss every once in a while
what had gone on
better running automobiles
that sounds real good
i believe i would probably tend towards that
my husband and all the men
i think she loved that dog more than i did
people do it for their children
everyone grow up and mature
anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink
on the radiator behind the dresser
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours
i have an hour here
bunch of books that i read
it was a pleasure talking to you
like any lottery
i decided to do it i haven't talked before
he's almost a teenager
i think it's a little bit inefficient
there was some really nasty patronizing
the kitchen table
we will worry about who he is later
i was in education and in administration
he's gotten good service
which leads me to my next point
especially with teenagers
a lot of things we don't like
we change our rights with our social status
that really adds up too
we're close enough so they can do that
people seem to enjoy it so it's a good thing
she'd much rather be here with me
i could do it now
a decision is expected in august at the earliest
they're just too weird to work on now
and what was the point of it all
i just don't understand that
gouging your eyes out
he said what did you get a deal for
that was all we ever saw
we don't ever catch enough to eat
you have children i take it
they won't take those
i like sound tracks a lot
i'm calling you from work
they had chosen santa barbara
he wouldn't really talk about it
who was that with
i'm also in dallas
we're probably reaching a successful stage
what do you think about places
it is just wonderful to talk to you
then other groups come in and do the services
they had permanent tickets
harm or injury
that concerned me
you have to have a roof over your head
houston and san antonio
it was overnight
what have you seen
moving around
came out around the first of the year
they're not going to change that to meters
they're going to go on a cruise
i had to work in an elderly home
if there's a game on
which makes a difference
there's no other way
well that sounds wonderful
couldn't catch one to save your life
it's a real good concept
do you have pets
it's a miniature
i'm an engineer
it was very modern
my mom's like i am
whatever pop we drink
it was an interesting theory
is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
i feel the same way
i don't think we gained any weight from it
i always wanted to go to school for nursing
it seems like you get hit the worst
on the south side is all glass
you go outside and play
i'm not sure about the name
why don't you tell me about yours
it's situational
in the common areas and in the island
if they're above the knee they turn into shorts
in a new house everything is white
we have an eleven year old
they were pretty much in good taste
i wasn't really keeping count
winning a sweepstakes
i don't really know how to resolve this
something back in the sixties
i had a call the other day from birmingham
running their country for them
no income taxes in texas
i have many a time called him to come get me
where are they going to get the money
at least in this country
it means that i don't have to cook
frequently purchase and read
it was just so realistic
god will take care of us when it's our time
i wish i could
don't overcook it though
everybody is there to have a good time
neither kid likes to practice
you know we have to think about that
you had pretty good luck with one coat type paint
i hope i never have to use them
wouldn't have the language barrier certainly
i agree with you
monday night is real good with me
i just finally ended up going to see it
a pretty significantly small number
i would like my next car to have good gas mileage
actually i even understood it better
they don't want it to change their lifestyle
some of them were even better behaved
are you going to trade it in on this new one
it's not industrial engineering
they're saying other people were
driving for thanksgiving
he had a hot pad
it would make me sick
i was thrilled to death
i just came in from outside
then we get out of that phase
i know which one it is
which ones are you watching
i don't think i would have insurance
he suddenly got sick
i think that i don't
i do agree with you
i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
cultural change within the management first
exercise is not supposed to do that to you
the house is forty years old
i am nervous in dallas
it's not that much of a bother really
they waited a couple years
it's the other way around
three hours difference
actually the lions are pretty good
in hospitals
survey system
they consider it violent
i've been there
at the higher echelons
your favorite inexpensive places
i think they need that
i have discovered that
that's a great salad in summertime
my kids were quite small
i haven't seen too many lately
i have fun doing it
they cross pollinate just by bees
he's written a lot of books
i'm just a regular looking guy
i think that's a possibility
we jumped in on the western tip
we have a hot tub in the back
maybe we'll get your guy
as near as i could tell
she didn't have to do anything anymore
i heard it on the radio
beyond a reasonable doubt
especially in the presidential elections
she had to go back to work
i got it right after high school
i was going to say i always enjoyed that
it's hard not to like it
who did work back in nineteen eighty six
at first that always kind of bothered me
there's an employment problem
i think she has problems with that
in rebellion against the united states
that's kind of funny
you have to do something
at night you can go walking in the shallows
tour sort of thing
i think that's real dangerous
you have to really just get an accurate amount
i remember when i was that age
that gives us special time together too
except you get to taste the product instead
i think you'll get a real kick out of it
under the stands
they're actually going to extend it
that's kind of a basic thing of economics
they need to make a living
see that's the thing
no thinking involved
sometimes it doesn't work
they had people who did
i want to take a few of these
i certainly can't argue with that
look at the statistics
they just couldn't
his side of the family
that's probably the worst
neither one of us knew much about cars
our son's not as interested in it as our daughter
i have to say that i'm honestly for it
i have not been out of school that long
it's really cute
the test is a booger
i just didn't know
an undergraduate degree
i was careful to keep her away
it's been really good
you are the one who signed up
overcast and threatening rain all day
what do you do
something besides license plates and tiddlywinks
we don't listen to any elevator music at my house
we don't want them back this year
that sounds really nice
we're heavy into that too
that is just personal feeling
children of my own
i can't even remember
the little boy dies
i've seen pretty woman and dances with wolves
it destroys their libido
i've seen them on tv
i think that is an excellent program
i'll stick with it while it's good
to make a little extra money
i would much rather own my own home
it loses it somewhere
who did you vote for
it's hard for me to imagine that
when you stop to think of it
how much coverage
i used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact
what good is that
i remember one time up in nashville
it is very comfortable to drive
after five years
down here i haven't fished much in texas
i'd love to get used to that shotgun
how long have you been in this house
even at home here now
i'd probably buy another
i just got a little booklet
that's what i hear
he was friends with my children
the stepping bike
i have such a big army outside of my place
you can't do that
we are really saving a lot of money
how long are we supposed to talk for
what kind of shoes do they wear down there
i guess there are a few things around still
it had to be done
once the children were grown
you sort of play every now and then
from what i can tell
not just some doctor's office somewhere
he's out of there
i was born in sixty seven
check our teeth once a year at least
is everything still pretty square
wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower
the organization can use the help too
he couldn't even check the oil
for a hundred dollars
that's always fun
he's been put away
i haven't really heard much about that recently
when the kids get older
free major medical for all
treasury did not immediately provide a comment
that sounds so easy
i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out
there are several reasons for the confusion
their statistics aren't very accurate
it is a conversion thing
i ended up at the theater
no reasons were provided for the decision
it keeps you in the company
arts and sciences college
be able to play a little more
out into the world
they're wonderful
he was a movie director
it's not your decision to make
give a voice to the voiceless
we've sort of had an ideal spring
a junior league achievement
maybe they're counting on that
are you happy with this decision
i've just been doing it
it's a lot easier then
we're not feeling too well over here
what led to the decision to start a record label
i picked it for a couple of reasons
you have the chance to really create
my husband just died
good housekeeping
that's what i call home
are you familiar with that
some of that is really bad
i can cut that much off the end
at this point it is what it is
you really have to watch those interest rates
you have to look around at the school
in the back of our minds
i've caught a few worthwhile snappers
however there is no actual way to measure this
after we got married we moved
that kind you've read recently
stay in one single family home
he got off right away
i found that really helps
it's not quite that hot
get them out there
make life and death decisions for other people
a built-in window box
away from his wife
been on a cruise
i wasn't really
did you have to draw a line
that would be tough
the sooner we make that decision the better
he was talking about the three things you could do
they don't go and see them
they are out in six or seven
she was delivered the next day
i think it's interesting to look at
mostly just the lakes around here
again our choices are not made in a vacuum
my husband's retired
why they're kind of behind
that worked out very well for you
trump's budget is just a proposal at this point
this brings me to the next point
clearly this guy is trying to make a point
why was this decision made and why now
you don't have time
every little bit helps
i'm not sure i'd do that
i can't think of the name
trying to stick in with that
we saw a policeman
there was no immediate word on any casualties
i've been making a hot sandwich
we chose to have our official feelings hurt
i think nursing homes can be good
and on that point i have to agree with them
it's just a couple hours
i watched the news
those jurors don't know
meditation or whatever
a garbage bag in the garage
maybe more qualified
i was having to walk along the highway
we send some of it out
i don't much care about things like that
keeping things concise is usually the way to go
we hope you enjoy and share us with your friends
they both cooperate together
she has two little boys
we can help you make the right choice
we like our area
many of our local power plants
i feel better
do you enjoy working on this kind of stuff
how did you feel it went
you are trying to avoid paying taxes
it's nice for them
there's quite a few
don't eat the yolk at all
he said he's been saying one more
aid to other countries
this was in a bathroom too
i like good family shows
just so you'll know
after an entire semester
i haven't been back in five years
we do everything we possibly can as a family
i may or may not even look at the tv guide
crimes and atrocities before
i'm a single mom
our church each year
it's right there at the very foot of the rockies
i've found some doctors
draw your own conclusions
they have exercise
very much compared to my mother in law
i don't care anything about that
that's because he's probably doing what i do
about the fourth day
you'll have one or two that are good
i think that's what it is
if you really computed it
i think they were very happy
we are grateful for the pleasure of serving you
one evening or something
twenty something
some really significant things coming out of it
but the treasury insisted that was not the case
my husband didn't like that
i saw that the other day
because their dad was at work
if young people had to do it
you say it is all voluntary
even though they didn't bring it in
i can hear it in your voice
i think our next car
which is most unfortunate because we all lose out
anyhow i guess we both agree
what i saw on the news today
i highly recommend it
that will get them out
was it the right decision
you really think so
what did you think of the coverage of the war
there's times i need to pay bills
you don't see that much
afghan hound and chow
no decisions have been made at this time
they're up there also
i've known people that have used a package
who you never expect to win
then it takes three weeks in all
he attached himself to a couple of those
what kind of business is it
you can see the code at this point as well
i thought it was pretty good
i am an asian woman with a white boyfriend
i don't know if dallas is in the top three
i do plant a lot of beans
it's so funny
nobody uses anything that's smaller
they take their family
you can get that too
i put in a dollar
we do have one in
you're just a youngster then
now we start in may
i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off
good storage capacity in it
i'm in one community band here
that's destroying the ozone
it's too expensive
that's what they said
i really haven't seen any movies lately
i may have to see the video
there isn't any
i work with the state
but the thing was that i could do the job myself
that's all i have is boys
seemed like the whole world
how shall i say it
if you didn't mind me asking
i didn't have any answer for that one
the taxes on gasoline don't
maybe that has a lot to do with it
all you can do is put it in words
even doing that three or four times a week
obviously not of the original time schedule
they don't see each other very often
my point of view
i think that's a shame they need to
it's a real good book
i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon
i don't like having credit cards for every store
he has been so pleased
it's going to happen all the time
that's fairly easy for me to work on
we know what we can do
people have to be involved
gardening in texas is really interesting
they do have a variety of topics
from the dallas area
he's supposed to be
i've been here three years
well there's not any
there's a ring and you buy a present
you wear a jacket
i don't really care what it takes to qualify
that's the way they wanted to do it
an american grocery store now
i just got married
i use my personal computer constantly
who claimed that
he'd be running with a gun
i guess it has been a couple of years ago
i don't really know for sure
that's how life goes
it was something easily forgotten
rent all the movies
if i were to cook
we have to go where there's restrooms
how large is williams
our lot in life is to make her life miserable
old college buddy
that's about where i stand
they'll do fine in their studies
they used them in afghanistan
you could mail it in
you would be susceptible to stuff
in the old testament
those games are fun to watch
that's what i'm majoring in
be familiar with it
it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then
they can get a real life experience
five hundred miles
i don't know who looks forward to it more
pay for paper to recycle
they buy a place and they just hate the area
what's the weather doing
that makes such a difference
a little bit with refugees
we moved in about four years ago
on monday evening
that was outside
i keep thinking that there's got to be some way
government contracts
and so i just recently discovered jazzercise
i absolutely loved it
minor problem
i saw something the other night about it
they'd never picked it out
it's on the border
restaurant with the lions in the front
it's collecting dust right now
you live in pennsylvania
we are having a deck put on in back
you'd think you would be
it's getting built up
a couple of years ago
it's rather hard
the question was talking about the juries
that was just me
you might be like i am
at the last minute
with what the subject matter is
my children are all grown up
paid normal taxes
i can't remember who the artist was on that
she's never been anywhere
it's nice to have another person there
she is to this day
unless it's like a fast food kind of thing
after that's cooked
you're welcome anytime without notice
if nobody complains you're all right
beef and broccoli strips
let them go
just a change of pace
i believe in capital punishment
they just maybe work harder
i really don't want to stay in news
they talk about wind chill here all the time
you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody
that's what they look at it as
than he thought it would be
the course that they should go
you still need your mother
little bit of soy sauce
it would be nice to see it take a good turn here
we've only lived here a couple of years
because of a service that they could provide
it's not that far
if there are some people who don't agree
if you had children
usually don't exceed that
we tore all the rest of them up
would it be appropriate to
the other case was just traffic
her husband builds pianos
you're at baylor
you know what eucalyptus is
an introductory subscription
that was his whole war
it's eastern hardwood
i didn't catch anything
that's why they call them swimming pools
you weren't just in their class
so much potential
if you want to play tennis
you just have to keep buying them
i've had him probably five years
like fifteen years
i'm not sure how they do that
what changes would you make
we'd like to do a float trip down
but of course
i guess i would say it's not easy to find
there are a number of good movies like that
you're not finishing a quilt in a long time
maybe people are becoming more aware
basically it's a market survey
i'm familiar with that one
i have this really good recipe for this
because you put such a commitment on education
some old movie
i don't have as much time
doing their part
about the same i dress for school
it's been real busy
a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
we have a female governor
they're kind of rare
many other responsibilities
i'm pretty laid back
if the gun shop owner does it
in your instance
i suggested to him
i try to catch the game every weekend that i can
and that's what it falls under
is pretty unfocussed at this point
food pollution
they had not been made aware
for a long time they didn't do this
i'm saying let's move right on
that's nice you know
when he went camping last year in beavers bend
that was two days a week
you know more and more of them are
one of the things that is a problem
in the winter i wear sweaters
that's pretty much the south end of the state
were they like all in dallas
treated wood will also chew them up
this is going to be the only one
if there was a credible punishment
i'm up there at my kids' school
they had a lot of them
do we think that the government should finance it
that's the one drawback
territory and everything
but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain
i love going to watch a game in arlington
that's about what we do too
i've been doing it for probably ten years or so
it's better that a thousand people go free
the stuff that happened to them
two usually three times a week he takes his lunch
your time will come
you really need to
if you marry somebody a little loose
i keep saying we need to have one
i have seen a few people do it though
there's a little bit of brown sugar in there
my wife and i did have a budget
condition of employment
at least for the first couple of years
pro football
back to regular exercise
i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine
then they have naps or rest period
they can't survive
there's not many half hour shows
tell me about your home
we like surprises
i know the taxes are a lot higher
that go on to a variety of colleges
do design studies or something
it's been something else
they've looked at i think twenty three teams
eventually i'm sure they will come out
it is kind of hard
that is a problem
nine year old daughter plays cello
i felt so bad if i didn't
to know what's going on
it is just a real pain
what kind of running do you do
do you mind if i ask what it's worth down there
everything has changed for me from that point on
when we bought it
we got pretty lucky on that
i wouldn't take it apart
i was thinking about throwing some
two seasons and that would be spring and fall
i have to be real careful
you need a special nursing home for that
i was impressed by them
the more tax you pay
and i have to admit he has a point
in terms of demanding
the kid's having to give up his
that's what i was about to say
which one do you like
i live in a farming community
what is this
we're backing it
that's excellent advice
there's no reason that we shouldn't do it
i type up the tapes of what people talked about
it's easy to check messages
you get a lot of graphics in there
these may be the droids you are looking for
no decision has been taken yet on the cremation
illegal or something like that
growing up on the farm
wait five minutes
for trump this is business as usual
to make this whole thing work
it's got to have those things
i can't believe they can
the decisions i made were mine and mine alone
it's kind of difficult
my wife was president
i think this is like two years ago
republicans were also dismayed by the decision
she didn't feel that public schools were safe
i was reading the paper just this morning
the trial is expected to reach a conclusion soon
department stores
boy what are you doing here
it took me a long time
that may be our only answer
they have a pretty good size waiting list
i didn't even really think about it that much
for the month
as much as you want
i think i'm really going to enjoy it
you know i don't
have you done any jogging
that forces you to pay for it
i just bought a new house
that is true but it also misses the point
that's getting back to a little bit chillier
why do you want to destroy me
but if you really want to relax have a massage
doesn't think about it
there may have been a problem
please see my disclosure page for more details
how does climate change fit into the equation
a really good companion for me
if someone came and heard it
it's a tough decision he said
there are people who fish
what's your second favorite
you sound so young
the treasury declined to comment on the case
we'll probably be talking to you again
they space it out
so you've come to a definite opinion on it now
that was almost an example
i had never heard of such thing
we find something we like
i took spanish in school
might remember to do it
they're not owning homes
i know people say
that's the one thing that really discourages me
conclusions and where to go from here
maybe brian will still be up
to go and see what it looks like
i don't have a problem at all with employers
through the newspaper reviews
have you heard stuff about him lately
it is a treasure trove of information
the cost of living is super high
they're cooperative rather than competitive
all kinds of physical problems
for a different company
it doesn't seem like i get anything done
the boy's name has not been released
you have a couple of choices here
i think that's a really interesting question
what do you mean by liberal
that was in the water
i don't usually like them
they would eat you
he was still a young boy when his father died
you mentioned the gasoline credit card
there are no reports of casualties
entirely too fast
obama immediately said he would veto the measure
after they've been laid off
his worth to the nfl is immeasurable
it's got an office down here
which leads me to my next point
to continue funding it
see other phrases that were coined in the usa
what kind of things are you looking for
every room leads to three rooms
i had plenty of snow
with the abortion issues and stuff
that's easier done in a company
she can do it
we should see to our own lives
i think that's all right
a good steak or a hamburger
it's not too hard
do we just go ahead
an assistant district attorney in chicago
what is the point of this
heat a medium saucepan filled with water to boil
especially when you have a family
i guess that's about all i have to say
it protects you from acid and corrosion
i guess we're both pretty practical
i guess it depends on who you talk to
this time i had no choice in the matter
i'm the type of person
i don't really subscribe to anything else
my dad wants me to go back
i started out wanting to teach
did you enjoy this episode
she really was good
we drove down to visit friends
i almost forgot the topic
you got young boys or girls
we're putting up with all her accidents
players come from outside of texas
which brings us to the final point
there's some nice stuff over there to see
thanks for discussing it
just our own design
well my children are grown
you might ask what is the point of this
if it's a good decision it's on me
live without dessert for the most part
ever seen one of these bad boys
i've heard about it
don't buy them that way
they're kind of nice
we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles
i see people enthusiastic about it
third world governments
that everybody's fighting over
then you want to be in
if somebody ruined their life
i want to work in the flower beds
i'm not really knowledgeable
we get disconnected all the time
i like amateur sports
usually it doesn't divide words
a fairly good amount
just adjusting to that
it's kinds of neat
i think it's real important to have friends
you have to fly through
that's funny you said that
how do i store my coins in a secure manner
reading it in the morning
there are three types of measures you can take
i think i can agree with that too
it's an absolute savings
i try to save that for the weekend
if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger
we're always paying taxes for something
i baked them a cake
enjoy what you just read
it's such a trouble here
i'll keep that in mind

enjoy having some drinks at the end of the day
take it to a logical extreme
they were so destitute

not as much as i remember growing up
i couldn't care about any of it
i just can't do it
sitting there wasting away
rent a car when you get there and all that
the further away i get
we used to do that
it seems like if you're getting to that level
the problem is she's a school teacher
sewing up the garment itself
you don't have much spare time either
i enjoy that too
as soon as things do get public
when she came up here
a couple of problems
if there's anything specific
i don't really like it
out of the state
i don't know how long you've been here
trying to get people interested in your school

fifteen year olds and a twelve year old

i really feel that
he has a terrible weight problem
i think they are smart enough
when i came back here
she isn't alive any more
there was a story of a woman last year
i'm a west texan
these are the ages of the kids
wherever you buy your paint
am i going to stand for that
our daughter found her and brought her to us
we built a shed over the long way
you do have a separate area

your final exam is a three mile walk
a lot of it goes down to just money
i had no idea what it was
in the district
he came out with the second one
then it won't be too bad
i think its relevance is pretty limited
they're parking the cars
one thing or the other
have you heard of it
i work as a news reporter
some other kind of thing
that's a previous generation
deserves punishment by death
i like chicago
i do like reading books like that

it has just been a really nice spring
to help decide what's the right thing
have all this fine mexican food
it was good weather
i'm going to school while i'm working
be careful about that back then
they don't recognize any time difference
that's great
but i guess you're always on call for it
i might like to be
i was in the service
when our daughter was looking at colleges
it's a real mixture
kind of a ivory color all over
some types of furniture
because she makes clothes
four hundred hours
we like the water sports too
i still go to right back to what i said
what's the name of this book again
it's not anything elaborate
i kind of set that aside and just pay for it
the industry in the state
he had to stay home
i had to change the water in that
they made it to the sweet sixteen
i remember when i was real little
most of the parents
millions of hobbies
one for a total ban
i can't say that
it's american made too which is good
i just crept over forty years old
my parents always said if we wanted a car
if you get pleats
i kind of like the cowboys i guess
i feel bad when i see the inefficiency
i'm about eight miles south of it
i think i went by location for one thing
it's fine
just jumped right into the job
he's going to
i have a standard
well i fell in love with this
do not even bother
taking what you're saying at face value
mine looks real good
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff
the headlines on the news
her life was a lot simpler
you just have to decide
just let me see what i got
isn't that interesting
a person's heart can be changed
she's more famous for that
what's going on in the city council
that was back in my granddaddy's day
it's channel thirteen
not one dime is deducted from his check
it's pretty soon
she'd just get on the first step and lay down
they're real difficult to catch
i have a really easy recipe for that
i need to get better at it though
i grew up in alabama
maybe south
so i can wander around
what are you doing with that
if i had all the money i wanted
sleeping bags
instead of being completely penned up
that's not so bad
in a way it's not
it shouldn't be that way i don't think
voiceover dialog spoken text script or lyrics
i have not gone back lately
what do you think of the spoilers
they pay so much of it
many of the casualties are women and children
between the rows and all
speaking of noise
i have no choice but to complete the mission
what are some of the benefits of visualization
how do you measure it
this is the vision that we have
but there was also a sad little voice in my head
so it's not all that unusual
is that what comes in those little blocks
the measure passed the house by a voice vote
a very true axiom
it was a tough decision
you usually have to grow up with it to enjoy it
it's pretty much filled up right now
we don't take the newspaper to begin with
how do you make a genre film your own
she asked them there if there was some
it might let more people get off
tax year of eighty one
her brow furrowed in confusion
bring the pot to a boil
as usual he did an amazing job
help guide some craft programs
i think it's a great idea
what's the problem with business as usual
what have your shows been like to this point
through natural understanding
i tend to listen to the classical music
so much about that movie
when i was growing up
eyes are the same color and everything
i wanted something else to do
so this is just a starting point
but at this point the facts speak for themselves
i'm not sure what happened
what do i have to do she asked her voice wary
his story is not unusual
that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty
it's just too high
who was raised by christian parents
it's a very short drive to areas near here
especially when it feels like there is no point
above all what i want to do is enjoy it
a certain percentage
germany is a case in point
both sides are bracing themselves for a decision
want to get rid of excess moisture in your home
at some point enough is enough
i am kind of a hobbyist
manage your app in the azure portal
i think those guys should be done away with
but when i do it usually brings me joy
decision will be based on 'science and evidence'
i made a decision in a moment of madness
we had the same kind of problem
have a less conscientious effort
they were told that
a lot of restaurants don't take
reports on the occasion of the sixth anniversary
i don't do much with it
that's why they were opposed to it
passing that on to each other
go here to register and let your voice be heard
we are quite simply at a tipping point
let us come to a conclusion
did the drug testing thing after that
there's a whole bunch of people
i could get a real good paying job
no casualties were reported
but he says the exact number is hard to pinpoint
they didn't have enough teachers
i think it would be fairer
we apologize for the confusion this caused
he slapped me and pointed the gun at my head
the meanings of those words
hope you all enjoy
i know it's older than the regency
less in collin county than it is in dallas county
investment is also affected by the tax regime
is there a price point or release date in mind
they should have been in there longer
voice of the people
interesting to watch
i work in a machine shop
when he comes the final decision will be made
south east asia is a huge growth market
they are real people and they are interesting
that's the national endowment for arts
if he's going to do it
actually i am reading a couple of different books
that decision is expected early next week
they're dangerous
that that will come about
you can avoid this problem in two ways
stay safe and enjoy your time out there
when they cut in and say
but it's so darn expensive to go over
and yet how many of us have ever heard his voice
are you involved in any other
how old are you all
it's still there
that was a turning point in the war
excuse me one second
the nursing home
she hasn't talked to anybody
he leaped out of the way to avoid being struck
if there's no economic benefit
there's always going to be a dispute
kind of a picnic in the woods type thing
they don't make pragmatic decisions
i think we have one of the nicest yards
the top headlines are always a murder
it's very successful for some
not identify yourself to the government
you're not ridged right
i haven't talked to them this weekend
i get things done faster
she is into a little bit of everything
this isn't for me
a little nativity scene
less than half the trials
let's get to the inevitable conclusion
sell you magazines
however i could sort of understand the decision
so at one point i had a snake
at the same point
pedestrians were reminded to avoid the area
local high school
to be my two favorite shows
since i do a lot of projects
you are on your way to getting more exposure
even though you can use it however you want to
from my apartment
i believe that i have made my point
well what do you do on your yard
it is atlanta
to where the children are
so it's been real fun here to see
that my civil rights had been violated
you know whose buying them
think about this
they had a program on
we've given up
if he got in trouble
it never really penalizes
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time
i missed that one
my mom and dad got it set up
a lot of people complain saying well
for the rest of you enjoy
the past few weeks are a case in point
we just got a disk the other day
sadly there has to be a collision
at that point in time it felt like a hail mary
there was only like two or three
that's what i had the opportunity of
i know dave fox
i think he can be
what am i thinking of
like cheeses or fruits or vegetables
if someone is ill
i think it's great
the way you handle garbage
it was supposed to be this june
that did the damage
in europe
a nursing home
we're getting ready to go
we like to go miniature golfing and to movies
taking them out to the show
i never have done it
i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet
i remember it
it's very impressive
think about how many automobiles there are
it's like seventy degrees here right now
my mother was real heavy into crafts
like in emergencies
my medical coverage
well actually they're my husband's pets
what kind of pet do you have
nonfiction lately
if you have an accident and no one's injured
i suppose you could use that
she took it with her
my family's not very big
it becomes more evident
they are doing such a terrific job back there
are those the big ones
do that because i have to pick it up
i would like to see them go through either
it's the tallest building on the west side
well i'm one of those rare guys
there's a good point
they're burning that diesel fuel
it just kind of feeds itself
they leave it up to you and your judgment
i didn't realize
all of her dreams will be dispelled
it seems like the stuff that they put out now
hike up those mountains
even the generation before me
i'm a former athlete in a sense
i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing
if it does the job
it seems silly
that is the reason i don't
on the first floor
i think i would have done a lot better
i just like getting out
ignore the others
decide on a pass
about three or four years old
that's before your time
doesn't seem like we have got much
they just try and make it a personal thing
you think that would be a deterrent
that's exactly what i have
it was quite popular
their success rate is very high
is this pat i'm talking to now
people would leave
what's the season
i teach at a public school
that will come back up
i like just about anything
they're going to school
who do you work for
sent out a survey
it's a community center
that's one thing that i wish we had more of
do they give any limits on alcohol
it seemed to me
i don't know that spending more always gets it
i still didn't want her to go to a day care
why should i even vote
i know two women
we've wound up sending in one
it's different staying home too
now it's coming back into favor
families are facing a challenge
i don't care for rock
we camped next to one
what recourse do you have
are kind of suspenseful
the glands had been removed
maybe get involved in a league
i hope you'll find him
most of her friends are working women
i have had a little
in the best part of the city
i grew up on blue grass music
some people are going to
thirty day notice for what
i'm glad you are
before they go to work
it's kind of more of a country setting
it was kind of getting to me
criminal history
that would be a mess
i just don't see it like that
i've done that before
i haven't been over
it would have been fantastic
he's just so big
they gave us a special deal
what do you call those things
just within the last three weeks
what a coincidence
it is not going to happen that way
exact amount that we spend on that each year
especially as they got older
we had one of the financial companies
you like the motels
what kind of cooking do you do up there
they go all the way up to the supreme court
how do you view this whole subject
that was a scream
special interest groups can blow up
so that's gone now
then i won't tell you
that's what i did when i was growing up
she has a young boy
we always do though
when my father worked there
every time i do something
really annoy a lot of people
i'll have to admit i don't
i work with adolescents
my sister in law is going to have a baby
i mean it's great to be well rounded
the religious organizations
you teach middle school
i had the grades to go to college
this is how an opera is supposed to be
when things don't go right
if i had a little cheddar cheese
his lips are moving
the weather is wonderful
whom i knew and how they were going to vote
clay pigeons things like that
maybe you wouldn't like randy travis
they're cutting back
i would hope we could do that
they shoot somebody
i don't want to call her a baby sitter
that would be good
i did well in school
i don't see much pollution going on
that's it a lot of the time
this summer we went to orlando for a week
as a matter of fact there's three of them
is it flooding anywhere
men can do housework just as easily as women
it depends on the subject actually
i like that one too
i missed out this last year
didn't have a place to put them
i don't see things changing really
that was impression i got when i was there
i know how they do it
that's where i need to go
he does the yard
do not just buy a coin then wait for it to go up
thoroughly enjoy
pictures and projects that you can make yourself
they want me to be a good boy
we try to do everything we can together
we had eight boys and one girl
also swims in college
more of the volunteer network service
unless you're playing it
what happens if i miss the occasional dose
average intelligence or something
in the event of a separation or whatever
if you had a choice of your car
we are going to go to
when i had my magazines at home
the jury that sentenced him
have pretty good meals
i have people that want to go to dallas
i think he's up in an attic
everything is just down everywhere
military service is not that much
can use all the revenue they can get
i wish i knew more to tell you why
i mean she actually asks to go out
well that's close to here
would have liked to have seen it
voluntarily give it because someone asks
all this kind of stuff
now it doesn't bother me at all
just like a pig i mean
before i retired
how long were we supposed to discuss for
i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore
we've been here for twenty five years
not like the eagle
the story was a very dramatic story
for a new job
this bingo place
they camp out and we spend weekends
have to have a darn good reason
that's a legal way of getting the guns
illinois state at north dakota state
you're not using any any energy
that's a long time
what keeps you doing that
at least the modern world today
i lived in detroit
i'm not real sure how that goes
changes have occurred at all
go one way or the other
i lived there
i know that the elderly can easily be abused
at the present time
which i understand is a really good
let me ask you the question
my son was just dying for a bird
that's a lot of people
not going to run again after this
time and mistakes and they're both inevitable
get serious about cleaning
dishes that are fixed in a chinese restaurant
what have you done
that's why i said
i couldn't believe how much
in other words there is a choice
i don't carry cash around
you got your calipers there
budgeting and some extra things
he called in to get somebody on the line
she has been writing for adults also
oh yeah young mothers
they seem to loose it
in town she does okay
then add soil to the bottom of your bonsai pot
this brings me to my next point though
i sometimes think that
at work that does that
in any event my decision was made days ago
i don't know what you do with them at that point
if i want to do that
cohen has denied any collusion with russia
we just made a decision and moved on
one of the questions they asked
hope you enjoyed it
the big one i thought was very commercialized
it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste
the death penalty
that idea fits me exactly
we put this stuff on
it wasn't creative
have something to do with it
go over there and rebuild all those
there's not that much of a check
your point of view and i think that's neat
when they were coming up
renamed their jobs
age or even physical
do you have a rotor tiller
this was when the peace corps first are started
what do you think
right now i think
it's totally ridiculous
i guess i haven't seen too many movies lately
that's another one
that's kind of blood and guts
regular pitching and my eleven year old
effective punishments
i would not have
they beat him up and took his gun and shot him
poor or in between
it's kind of early
employees have all the rights that workers have
sort of dangerous to be out there
they had left
race and things like that i mean right now
luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
they're so young
let the voice of the people be heard
those people simply did not have access to safety
i wish if they were going to do it
charges against the boy have been dropped
maybe now things are calming down again
that's a hard issue
i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse
the policeman's associations
that they have started
my mother used to put that curse on my sister
i certainly am too
i think we're terribly taxed
be safe take your time and enjoy the views
it's not enclosed
since i've become a parent
at this point mr williams was on the ground
just at the end of the month
and they both enjoy it
she wheeled it out on a cart
i figure i'm only taking on the weekend
it actually fell on the right day
you were just up there then
he's out for good
police are investigating the collision
try some of your baking
i'm a junior in college now
braves didn't win
now i have two little kids
budgeting activity in our household
i think it's a foregone conclusion
there's too many toxins and bacterial growth
eventually the decision was made
this can be seen as a measure of expertise
just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby
then you remove it
cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they
that's way out of my reach
i couldn't even think of what you call them
doesn't want to die on me
a pair of shorts and that's it
they lived on a farm
i tended some children
give you a run for your money
hanging on his clothes
once you get something fancy
i didn't watch them
have you ever played baseball
i don't know which artist is which
all the problems
in the garage
you hate seeing them
some of the news periodicals
i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff
a natural gas
i can't remember where i went to take them
i don't believe everything they say
i mean we're talking thirty years ago
the public puts up with it
you don't need any philosophy at all in school
what was the last car repair you had
have you done any recently
that's been a real big plus
i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom
what a light show
how do you feel about it
i think he deserves every penny of it
either state or federally funded
it's just where society is right now
we didn't really have one
you aren't a sesame street fan
you sit there in a crowd
it would work out
i think i see some change in attitudes there
it's really hard to say
as soon as i had them
today was pretty
i think it's a great idea
i can't imagine that well
at least you'll get very good at it
those early ages
saves you a little bit money
having really top notch service
i'm in the legal department
on our honeymoon
there's something about working with wood
i totally agree with that
it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
past the first playoff game
it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete
it was beautiful
hondas have great resale value
it really is not a bad summer at all
that's to be expected
this is probably typical though
we see our son and his wife
but never the snakes
when a teenage boy comes into his manhood
it probably comes from where you are
when i go home
we all had snack time together
you can enjoy your hobby together
go in the direction of a market driven economy
even that's good
the government doesn't have to deal with it
i like country and western
whatever you like
indeed it really is
it's a brand new book
what would be more efficient about it
they're not the most exciting pet to have
what she did with them during the day
always got a place for you
i think it's a very long day
you're working on your doctorate
i'm watching saturday night live here
do you watch cartoons a lot
it'll start stacking up
relatively nice environment
you know that's hurting us
it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it
don't any of those ever come to pittsburgh
when you leave a job
i don't know it depends
that was excellent
kind of all over the place
how about when you were in colorado
i wish they would require it
it's where all the executives are
we've been able to do what we can
a high rise for elderly people
it rains a lot
swimming never gets much glory
i always do my own income tax
on the way to school
it would probably take the whole news hour
they're not done on a regular basis
unless you have a lot of deductions
now i have kids there
it's a great place
scanned across the little bar code on our bin
every once in a while
that was about it
go help put the kids to bed
you never see them
have you had any adventures on your camping trips
they live with us
the penalty phase
may be a good investment
i've only seen snow once this year
i forget what you call it
we used to stir fry a lot
we just couldn't
they're just awful
i went to my exercise class one day
i don't know if you have them in your area
you have got to have it
i'm going to say you have an accent
been cutting the teachers salaries
it gets a little bit of everything
i work in the waiver
a bunch of psychiatrists
all the services are costing more money
i'd like to know that
i'm a quality manager
i'm so disgusted with the democratic party
they're always saying that somebody's going
that time is minuscule
it's just a matter of passing the law
public relations
on one of the local talk shows here
i kind of miss out on most of the current events
it's kind of like drawing this line
contractors and builders
i think that's one thing that was important
i don't use a calculator either
i thought they're crazy
i didn't quite understand it
it makes me feel bad
then they ought to
they report facts
if you plan a year ahead
is she going to stay home
when i bought my car
we don't listen to the radio at work at all
we rent a lot of movies
board of supervisors
i also made a little thing for a baby gift
he couldn't deal with it
you made me do this
i listen to a song
until it was nice and brown
it didn't matter
america's losing it
these people would never be able to get it
there's probably some of each
they're doing a lot of research here
it seems absurd that people will pay
the wind normally blows
regular gas engine
blizzards now have a new visual effect
i know that one of the day cares
what work are you in
just the regular channel
it's nothing like what it used to be
they're very comfortable
in this equation there are two variables
how did you make a quilt
but i'm sure i'm just being paranoid
raised in this area
they turn them loose
i think we usually have a frost in october
what was the actual starting point for the story
i bet you it is a dutch iris
a lot of people choose to
well i know about it
i just wanted more news
she wanted her voice to be heard
what do you usually do as far as budgeting
it looked like something out of africa
where was that at
your going to have to expect that to happen
so we don't have to have quite as strict
what was going on there
you consider how much
regardless whether it's north dallas or whatnot
there was no point in dealing with him
like that girl in new york that got beat up
i would probably pick sam huff
my voice has always been right in front of you
last year or the year before
attorneys care about justice
i got a twelve year old
tv's a surrogate parent
your decisions are bad and you should feel bad
i can't remember offhand what time
to me it's amazing
this is a turning point he said
then it's random and that's not necessarily fair
i have enough of that in my own life
i'm trying to
i've nailed the problem down
it's not david is it
and that gets me to my point
a certain kind of sound
inside the jail there
you are in new york right now
i've seen a lot of people that do that
i don't have a real love for miami anyway
vision for the future
raise my children
i don't know what the solution is
cia spokesman dean boyd declined to comment
what area of the country do you live in
they want the fun part
i saw city slickers
i think that a majority of the places in the united states
your feedback is welcome as usual
thank you for participating
there's a couple of things that really bother me
you can do graphs
any sports or anything like that
magazines and bills
left here in seventy six
your voice needs to be heard
i bet it had a pretty coat too
that when you say everybody get out of it
have a half bath downstairs
and hey that leads us to our next point
do you go see a lot of musicals
hope you enjoyed this tutorial
more areas where they would pick it up
out in the soviet union right now
that wasn't a standard
cream sauce with it and you pour it over rice
we stand with all those who share this vision
what changes do we see
they're going to have to go to the source
it's just brilliant
i enjoyed some of those stories so much
their own power structure
it slices great
i was the one that did the least poorly
i had one cat for eighteen years
they have your identification
all those european countries
it was just wonderful
mostly it dealt with
a lot of those are really violent type movies
there's life in there
it had real good tips
i see him out there
i don't know what per month
they can just dip it
my whole family's home
i do feel it is
one of those interests
well i really did not know
field of dreams was good
side dishes and appetizers
that was our last tour
exactly what things are
it was very nice talking to you
when i changed those over
you come out positive
here in texas they don't have snow
it tastes differently
he's really affectionate
i love cheese cake
i did peace corps training there
then we came back and ate
she feels that way
now that's another one i wanted to see
i would have more problem
one in the morning and one in the evening
we enjoyed having her here
have you had any experience with it at all
i really dislike those
you don't look at it
i've got a two year old and a four year old
i wouldn't see it
that was kind of funny
i have heard that's real good
why not have the whole service
on top of the federal tax on gasoline
they're not really cabins
it's kind of pricey
something like that they call it
i know you would
up in minnesota where i am now
i've been cut off twice
to make it more homelike
ours is not a working farm
we're going to go vote
with the nice lids
tried to break that off
i work at the applied research lab here
a whole lot to do with it
you've got to work for a living
i live right near white rock lake
that is horrible
i was just real curious when you said middle east
rather than just quitting where we did
i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody
life of a person
that's pleasurable for all of us
one on every hook
in terms of colorado
did a lot of growing up
he just quit a perfectly good job
biscuits and gravy
just channel eight
personal computers and level of interest
you can tell when you go around cities
the training bit
can ask for delays and extensions
a good appearance to do a good job where you work
my dad is a big blue grass fan
the man who was doing the separating
taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in
that is pretty much like my husband
i think it's four cups of flour
then by all means they should have the right to
i usually put garlic powder in mine
the type of music
on the space frontier
we figure we'll get the kids
they had been going to it for years
sort of like an exchange program
because it's not next day they have
not to go the same time all the time
what you're describing is actually a conflict
that i think should change
civil things that clog the courts
i wouldn't want them to be on drugs
and it's a real turn off to see
i couldn't understand
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair
a software engineer and i work in the software
i think that'd be neat
i come from florida
if i'm lucky
having to do more with the size of the school
i love to run in the rain
you keep up on it all the time
i have five in the kitchen at the moment
i think he'd like that one
our baby's quilt
if you happened to close it on him or something
i'd be tried by a jury
some days it just rings off the wall
lose your job and everything
friction between us
i don't know what to do if you can't afford it
i try to make sure
that sounds nice
that is really upsetting
is this some sort of a disease
my wife kind of laughs
all of the stations seem to be pretty good
it's the taxes here
orthodontic care
they didn't go to vote against
it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse
well that's a neat idea
maybe if they ever get to the point
handle and perform better
that's because i'm allergic to the grass
should he be for this and on and on and on
as far as this country is concerned
he would get all upset
at least we hope it will
i have a garden
that helps a lot
you just have to pick something
how many cats do you have
i've had the same experiences
you don't have quite as much money
what did he teach
a little over five thousand miles
no that's really when i grew up
i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs
twelve or fifteen thousand miles
i guess i'm like a lot of other people
i think the majority are in that
that's always good
it's going to be hard to
i don't understand
a lot of days i'll get two and three calls
on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada
i would love to
you do have government money to fund
that was pretty heart rending for her
they don't have a disk drive
boy i'd sure like to
it does a lot for you i think
when the earthquake hit
that can't be good for los angeles either
i don't know what it's like
i like to visit with my company
do you belong to that
then don't pay it
i'm sure it creates a large amount
really major job
if it's going to make any effect
i just pushed that in
i seem to feel the same way
i've got about twelve tickets in the mail
about three years ago
you would like it
in the operating room a lot
it got to be pretty big
that's why i don't do as much as i'd like
we camped at the degray state park in arkansas
it seems to be validated by the press
i do not know what
when you make that point
this was in louisiana
she was in there first
i think that would be a wonderful way to do it
why don't you go ahead and start
last week we got a lot
everybody hopes that
where you live now
i don't really like the pirates
we'll have we reached our limit
i don't know why it's so hard to find
preparing is a real problem
what are the ages of your kids then
i don't really particularly like but
i don't remember which other one it was
six weeks later they're back to work
some of the time
sign papers that say this is yours
they've come from so far down
come down about halfway
what the kid was doing
its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms
we've kind of driven these people out
you can still get a good idea
go to anything that's real expensive
everything's geared towards young
much more to contribute to the topic
the lenses for cameras
our band practice is on monday night
two and a half hours to get there
a vegetable garden
we decided to stay
up a couple of feet
if it's paper it will probably shred
we're just more or less at american express
i don't know how familiar you are with maryland
you really aren't isolated
everybody just loves it
now that the grandkids are here
within two days of each other
we had an occasion
i don't even know
i bought a lincoln and i like it
this is their compensation
i don't know that anybody knows the answers
you take it easy
which is a good thing
we have an investment plan
happy to go hiking
i can never quite stay current with that
the end of the civil war
worked most of my life
the creek overflows
you got some lakes around you can do that
you probably get this
they're both very good
working in that condo
in the case that you brought up
we do get an awful lot of music
i probably have one of every credit card there is
i feel really bad that it's turned so much
i have a friend who is working
if you could include that in benefits
let's say typical
we've had our way of life
we go out with friends
well i'm definitely for it
i mean i guess you could take those off too
to compensate for some of the benefits
i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting
oklahoma's nothing like it
how strong is it
i've just been called
i know my daughter saw that and she liked it
our kids might be in a great school
i used to have a chevy
just being around young people
her last sister died
practice makes perfect
i do remember demonstrations
eighty years or so
we went to carmel
i don't know if you've tried it
is in good standing in america and china
perhaps not in dallas
we got ripped off buying our new car
even when he's sad
sometimes it gets to be excessive
my next trip is going to be to texas
you can do it as long as you want
they can provide for society
i came in backwards
it was not necessarily local
it's interesting we got this topic
you can't stop people
you're from where
evidently was elected president
maybe they will come through
that's mostly my son's
from business people
we have a huge chemical data base
in some of the more crowded states
they love violent leaders
the same city or county
i wore suits
just get rid of them
lo and behold
they had to abide by the rules
tomatoes grow like crazy at our house
i tend to agree with you
if you don't pay it off within that month
i'm not the one who writes the orders
not going from side to side
what are you thinking about buying
there needs to be a line drawn somewhere
some people seem fairly well suited
what did he say about it
he didn't make it
this is before i was born
get around to it
cars passing their emission tests
i doubt if zucchini is in there
they have to be in charge
i like the classics too
this is ridiculous
some more than others
there is kind of a set pattern to it
my kids were born
did you have training in singing
just pocket change to a lot of people
we're living longer and people are less trusting
most dogs do that
it helps you hang onto your roots
we have incredible property taxes down here
well i'm going to
we're not quite up to that sort of thing
she enjoys that kind of stuff
they just had this jewelry account
they seem to be
you have one floor all to yourself
i think they only have four boys
it's easy to say
seventy nine degrees
with other things going on
some more jewelry
is it legend
did you see any of those
i didn't feel like she was mature enough socially
it's not as severe
tell them some of the things we're doing
you don't want to do that
even what you recycle
they were very flexible
i never did get into them
i've always had a big interest
it gets a little aggravating
they've got a nice one
i wonder what the next generation will be like
there was no structure
we tried to do it every other month
for a while i was doing it every day
would you like me to go first
i'm not good enough for that
they got some interaction with someone
my son has a cat
she went through three housekeepers
they were very good
just moved here
i mailed off a check but then it was too late
that would be great
i noticed those dogs
in my married life
eligible for a fine
i mean you can just sit
the worst quality of food
go to the dining room
i produce quite a bit of trash
jeans aren't exactly professional
he always got this
we would want to invest
you've got to do something
a lot of other companies will
well we have one through work
sounds like a place where i grew up
it's not that big a thing this year
crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution
depending on my size
i've always kind of enjoyed it
we really didn't plant anything
i live near a walmart
one of the best things to do
we were heavy into affirmative action
it's kind of fun
you've got half a string quartet there
so many of them nowadays
that wouldn't be too bad
when he sees it to his advantage
it's a precious movie
that make a decent salary
i don't have any good ideas
then it gets to where he can't
and i think it's showing up in their automobiles
if i miss something big deal
i thought it was great
i just keep them
through to the system
it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom
it looked to me like it was a real submarine
a longer period of time
when i was still smoking
we're retired now
they're coming from various places
it's going to be from the ground up
denies you a driver's license
put them by the curb
they pick that up on monday
have you noticed that
miles per hour to kilometers per hour
a lot of people they flunk out
there's not a lot of pressure to
it's a lot of fun
it's going to be on a cruise
i do not have one of my own at home
people will have batteries
whatever works for you
used tremendously
i would back them a hundred percent
it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
the baby is young
i really don't have any problem
a job to make money
i know there's not any food that you can get
i know i want a big family area
house robberies
whether one might conceive
would not be an unreasonable thing
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had
covered all the subject
our shepherd was almost thirteen years old
domino's a real good dog
we've got some this year
rains a little too often
which i thought was a lot
especially for repeat offenders
the situations are out there
you didn't have home computers
it's like god changes your heart to not do that
yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage
do they like it where they have tents
all right i'm ready to go
post high school
on occasion i can wear jeans
that kind of reminds me
how many times have you called by the way
we really had a good time
cut money on your taxes
there were five of us and i don't recall
there's a big military constituency
have them pick up around the school yard
recreational facilities
they sound familiar
i wouldn't say any more than usual
they just take to it like candy
call my own hours
are there kids that are there too
i have not gotten them in a long time
what changes do you feel have happened
the american german shepherd
san antonio isn't that close to you
i guess the sanitation department
good to remember
i'm very much in favor of gun control
it would be in that region
please do not be involved
in terms of drugs
my father owns a restaurant
that's one thing about cats though
if you haven't done it in a while
or a monthly budget
the next like my cousin's children
then it became winter
two girls and two boys
we maybe want to overthrow the government
for a rifle there's no waiting
my wife likes to spend
one of the arts that i think are really pretty
the monitoring is not that bad
other three who went
take a lot of chances
at least traditionally
that is exactly where we are
i think they're going to
i like to think that i'm a very good cook
it's one that you can live through
they were elected as well
it comes from trees
he's fished all over the united states
which is probably about what their equity is
we had another cat about two years ago
he's in his sixties
i want every child to be on task all the time
mine taught kindergarten
she needs to find herself a lawyer
companies drug testing prior to hiring
they both moved way out
what did you do about your last auto repair
train accidents and everything else
that is mediation training
that's not her bag
so i can't complain too much
since there is much that needs to be done here
they said something to improve voting
it's your choice where you want to go
if it goes down
i really like those and i have kids
we've got tons up here but i don't know
a majority of the jury
are ruled by their kids
i think you'll like it better
before i moved out here
light reading
criticize you or put something in there wrong
it was a little bit hard to
i like groups like that
the way they behave
he dug a hole under the fence
you've passed me up
to continue in that vein
i'm sure i didn't
they keep calling back
does it cost the same for just two nights
a particular kind of shoe
i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing
i'd tell him
a matter of choice
that lived in new york or out of state
those are really nice
i've never had a call
the last time we had some
had somehow gotten in
now that i'm older
that's good to hear
quite a bit more taxes
do you paint or anything like that
you can take those
i heard it one time
sell products abroad as much as we bring in
with the government
i don't know about you
in the rice steamer
what i have to ship
you're allowed to show their character
they've always been with us
well mine's getting there
it's a four door which is nice
we had two baseball bleachers full of people
twelve different major ski resorts
pressing needs in the marketplace
if he can raise enough
they are to be subjective to their husbands
al capone had three brothers
i do my own yard
they adopted the death law again
i value her opinion
you don't really miss anything
have an electric car
i hope everything works out up there
we don't usually mix
like a taste of something different
sometimes it's rewarding
that's what i said
that can stay in power
i was very offended
they think that's a family activity
they're downstairs aaron
trafficking has got them
they come out fairly easily
i've just never been called up
i was from illinois
i don't buy them
she stuck my name on some list
you have a bonus
you can as a teacher
i bought shoes
it's going to be reduced
this is an invasion of privacy issue
more like the sixties and that kind of stuff
the quality of the news you get
how are we going to fix that
it's very degrading
all those nursing majors
he'll change out a light switch
there is lots to see
before they started
to really challenge them
it's not the same with johnny carson
i guess i'll get over it
to deal with in some quality way
i don't want any interruptions
i've heard they're terrible
do you want to start
it works just fine
i think they're a good team
the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
the regular hospital
it's been quite a few years
i am an asian woman with a white boyfriend
i guess it's too early
i think they are
it went quite a long ways
the girl is four
exactly the same thing
now we come to the hard decision
there is a long ways between now and that point
maybe one or two country and western
it's nice talking to you
although they don't admit to it
information systems
it's like bragging on your grandchildren
where do you go camping at around here
it still looked real nice
those were the general issues
now it's looking better to me
they just kind of forget us on that end
actually purchase the gun
since i've got cats
the kids of these people
it did not really mean anything to me
and then you just cook them over a grill
i can honestly say we do
march the fifteenth before it was prepared
when i first started working
i'd like to get the weight off
i used to use it quite a bit
mine's about twenty seven hundred square foot
that makes you real good
you could hardly wait
maybe when you are there
you said something else
i don't know what they are right now
that is the key to the longevity
well that's the way mine is
it was about four or five years ago
we bought a second hand
they just accept it
time flies so fast
the thing i really worry about
that might be too crude to be called woodworking
buy one get one free
it's going to take me a lot longer
so what do you do up there
a couple of children and we have to
i think i'd agree
now that's inside again
when you have children
i did the dance step
how many do you have
the hard back copy of it
they basically would have
i saw plenty of jokes
that's neat isn't it
it's not a big deal really
it seemed like dallas was so open
it was my mother's uncle
it says they won't eat the babies
and they don't have a waiting period
it's like a major production
the presence over in the persian gulf
you have to get everything replaced
i'd have to basically say my birth
we were going to be metric
i made some of them with that hair
where they go for an hour or so
covered it with grass
it had all the vegetables in it
i ran my kids to death i said
the immune system can at first slow down
i watched that game
rehabilitate you
it was interesting
i want to make a lot of money
you're kidding
i'll probably have to sell the prize i get
probably seventies
it's not good for a second watching particularly
there's a lot of sections to it
my cars don't go to the shop
they really hadn't either
like nineteen times
i better make some calls
maybe you're still allergic to the dog
but i never count right
mostly they are token cuts
now in criminal i guess you always have a jury
so we're attempting it
especially not in some of these big cities
i've had one idea
get a home
or else we're going to be out of business
i am pretty aware of what goes on
of course at that point we couldn't afford it
what is it called
it's just a terrible choice
i can't remember which
i don't know if you've heard of her
how are you doing today
this bad for so long
it's either me or the dog
that's pretty much what it is
definitely when it's cool
a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay
something every day
i mean to use any of the facilities
your family doesn't live close
they're all kind of local and close
we have been trying for kids
to work in some programs
we felt guilty
is peace corps still active down in there
my resting pulse
i think that's most of it personally
the guy gets captured by that women
i'm sure it does
i guess that's kind of like the way we do
they're really good cars
people find ways around
there is some danger to that
have you read any good novels lately
that's just an extreme example
you take care
how i would deal if one of my parents came with
murdered and so i really wouldn't know
to return to her apartment again
but you got to like queen also
see it's about six years old now
so i called them and asked if i could participate
member of the american meteorological society
a lot of their things
for all the older people
at least the parents did
then you could get it at the reunion
those are the only states i have not visited
unique show and very well done
i can't disagree with that
have established the defendant's innocence
i haven't quite figured that out
it was paid for
because the porch is pretty big
i don't know exactly what's hot down in texas
with whoever is taking care of the child
is it all voluntary
in the winter we do more concert stuff
they had snacks and story time and everything
a big expenditure to start
some of those countries were so safe
some really good years
that's not very likely
so i don't mind doing it so much anymore
i also got a piece of chrome
a little more assertive
i wore some fairly nice jeans
i guess i was about ten when it ended
on going project
we have a dog too so that adds to it
beginning of my junior year
that's our channel here
she is more wrinkled
that's what i see burning a lot
according to the following utterance
we're kind of at the end of that trail
here we are talking on that subject
is it cayenne pepper
you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle
they have really simplified things
you can pick anything you want
how do you feel about it
i never see that
was it very expensive
that's what i was
throw the paper away
no frivolous gifts
my daughter in law is panamanian
are they going to later
i took a drive up through there
now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure
january or february
we didn't understand the culture
you can program the one at cosmopolitan lady
if not the biggest yard
the last presidential election
to finance or accounting
every thursday night
they get lighter sentences
an awful lot of people are in trouble
there is just so much going on
i really like it
i guess we're talking about exercise
twice for the same crime
that's very spicy
to have enough time to spend with matthew
they had us fill out a long questionnaire
could be just about equal
but they're not making new ones
it had such a good story
except the three networks
the dryer had to have a new heating element
isaiah came back this week
don't you hate that
my husband is real into sports too
set back in the woods
an english setter
the insides of the door panels
they just raised them to twelve this year
well that's understandable
what do you think is your primary cause of it
the nature stuff
it's always had it's own unique look
i lived in places
then do it that way
if i lived in new york city or washington
i'm not doing it as much as i need to
rugby every now and then
are you a hacker
he just piddles on this and that
like in a dead end job
as they occur all over the world
she can't run in the morning
it's actually just twelve years old
i think not even the old one but the new one too
a daughter who's almost two now
i think because it costs less
they have to just go through everything
a lot of difficulty
he won't pull them
my husband is a counselor
it starts everywhere until we can't
as long as you want to
i'm not much of a basketball fan either
because of how wicked they were
the nature shows
in december or january
but that's the point
come tell me about it
it's in the forties
i didn't sing in a choral group
three weeks of use
do you know some folks who have been there
segments of my speech
we're within walking distance
you get the death penalty
service charge you mean
some people grew up with guns in the house
which is allowed to be revoked
how do you get your main source of current events
things are doing pretty good down here
they've started a drug testing policy
i've been thinking about that for quite a while
what did you get your degree at
sit on the fence
particularly commercial productivity
it's like any other symphony
do you get money for it
i didn't need it
so they just wear them right into the pool
that's great that you have them
country western day or something like that one
you're going to be observed
he kind of has free run of the place
i grew up in san antonio
the people who spend the money
it seems like you walk quicker
it's a brick house
the trip to mars
there's too much going on
they're going to be in even worse shape
maternal grandparents
the bermuda triangle
a slap here and there
sometimes it can
of course you can buy stock in the company
of families and time
five hundred dollars
you can sit in the sun all day around the pool
i helped someone repaint an apartment
we don't have a real strict budget
we enjoyed yellow stone real well last year
a full time camper
he has it really nice
to separate the news from the comment
it was leaking inside the car
i think you're right there
this will be new for me
probably you're right
you need to rent the first one first
and you get to choose your boss
i can't remember what it is they don't take
knowing that to be true
i have a nineteen eighty six toyota
would give either you know
is that pollution
always a pleasure to see and talk to them
how do you avoid this kind of tragedy
so i let my son do it
they seem pretty
her body was found by her boyfriend
a little brief autobiography of themselves
nothing unusual about that
pride month is about inclusion and acceptance
you had some there
that's actually a good question
she didn't live with us
the decision was not welcomed by all
problems that men have in the realm of cancer
i haven't kept up with any
at this point i decided to file the lawsuit
it has been real good talking to you
stick it in the hole
do you still keep up with them
i don't use the free weights
if you are convinced that it is the right choice
i mean that's what i would like to think
they are to be there ahead of time
he'd be good at it
they haven't gone down
there are times when you can't avoid all that
the ship that was available
do you go for long vacations
i always get those
i've only been to philadelphia twice
it's an interesting job
have you been buying any clothes lately
my mother used to make an armenian rice dish
there's very little full employment
from my point of view he is
add your voice to the conversation
just about anybody you could name
i had heard a couple of people
i can get this yard in shape
i decided that there was no point in replying
we just had a ball
that makes it very frustrating
what's your name
it seems sad to me
a man who owns a building company
the court is yet to make its decision public
it's amazing how much we spend on some things
that really ticks me off
we could spend that money
i think we agree a lot on that
learn how to measure and score it here
if we are not the voice of outrage who will be
i don't have too much on credit cards
i never knew that
the plants and all that
you just couldn't believe that they would
some types of agreements to limit
will be a sophomore
at this point i'm surprised i'm not insane
chipped tile on the floor
i guess this is your first time to buy american
over by white plains
everybody is sitting here screaming
i haven't done that
i'd like to think that it's quite low
it's a scary thing to know that
i'm tired of pacifist though
we always had horses
i hope you guys enjoy it
scan the paper and look at them
you said you're from mississippi
what books have you read lately
we will head for florida
whether it's a murder case
it gives me no pleasure to see anyone struggle
she really enjoyed being part of the team
you can pick what you want
do you buy it at some major store
six thousand is just getting broken in for them
this guy's beating you up
if there is a decision to make they speak first
i don't think we'd need a whole church
before he was really active
i'm kind of mixed on it
they also have sales taxes
it's really hard to
i guess we do get it from people too
i can't wait to get out of high school
make it a practice when i am out
i listen to the radio
more or less at home
he expected conclusions at the end of the year
so you enjoy gardening
you know there are a lot of people around
i think they're getting ready to
well he does not usually drink he says
they would have been able to find him
it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one
tree bark all over her lawn
they didn't have this problem back then
just when i was in high school
well that's good
i voted with my feet
they can get away with one guy like that
regime change in iran
two thousand and ten was far better
it's hard to beat any of the benefits
a meal without any vegetables at all
the other place is called the vienna inn
i almost think there's some politics around here
things of that nature which made us feel good
then his voice started to get raspy
shut my other radio off here
i thought he was kind of cocky or something
it came out in the theater
i went back to school
it's doing a lot of damage
absent a dust cloud there will be no explosion
did you enjoy this recipe
especially if you're in a lot of traffic
uses more muscles than any other exercise
i'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine
sort of mixed feelings about it
after they've gone and done horrible things
a gun is a gun to them
a fairly large liberal arts college as well
florida and louisiana
i think piano is always good background
listen to the man hear the vision
now where do they live
even at a group rate
i never really thought of it that way
all i knew was you go to high school
been here all my life
you mean she taught in a prison
are you recycling
that and then i wasn't able to
i don't know that anybody would feel good
say the rice dish
which is the strangest thing i had ever heard
they fixed us up with an office
exactly what i did
mad at themselves when they don't do well
you knock people down
they want him because he's popular
i'm of italian descent
if you're serving another dish with it
they've not had to do that all year
she wrestled with the decision
the absolute top of the line
boxes that they use
we'll try to be real quick here
he has a vision for the program
you can take out the middle seat
we have hard decisions to make she said
i have heard about that
i do believe it should be befitting the crime
these were soviet made
their training isn't what we need in this country
about a quarter acre of that
i looked over at the card and made a decision
to buy my gas with
it's just so smooth
this plea bargaining baloney
i'm a dog person
our division does not have a dress code policy
this cannot be done by moral suasion
just to let you know
everybody is napping
prisons all my life
just last week
the cleanliness and that type of thing
very twisty stuff
or how you think this court case should have gone
i wanted someone to make my decision for me
interstate driving
we want to hear your voice
portland's pretty good
they have all really got really good jobs
the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
hundred and two sometimes
the decision rests as always with the referees
he's run into so many problems
it's was a night out
i know where my son works
our gardening we lost
seeing new england
starting to learn the colors
it seems sensible and failsafe
show some respect
then you can't spend it
and there was much rejoicing
get up during every commercial
are you enjoying it
turns out it was a prescription
did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to
how do you usually eat it
i couldn't even go there
he's doing some other movie
then it goes to the next point and so on
last time i saw the paper earlier this week
you never get a chance to read
in the punishment phase
i had two cadillacs
we got a chance to make some noise this year
we went to six flags saturday
i think that's the main problem
i'd like to see silence of the lambs
i think that's bad
if a child is a visual learner
anything on that
gives drug testing
we know the consequences of that decision
employees will not get any severance pay
do you ever watch cheers
school was certainly valued
i certainly hope so
you have to have it
mental acuity is easy to sustain
i'd be real concerned
i don't have a sprinkler system
it drives me crazy
i just do it all
you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy
was it a big change in your life
it's on down the line
twenty five in interest charges
it would be ridiculous
nobody could figure it out
or a row of seats actually
you understand what i am saying
to take care of a problem before it grows big
there was no word on casualties
the reality is it's usually not the case
i'm not sure
it's actually turning out to be more
be our first chance in awhile
it's too bad it happened
i have the right to voice my opinion
still have to spray some
my mother was complaining last year about that
when i come back to my seat
that texas twang or whatever you want to call it
nothing wrong with those
i love this country too much
who did they play
they were thrown forward
that can show up as a positive test
become an issue you could say
we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all
that's an interesting notion
if we didn't have it
that was the time to instill it
i am a golfer
they'll have these little parties
if they started executing them on a regular basis
they're testing that
whatever you decide
they each have their own television
now do things like plant bushes and trees
a tent by the lake type situation
the political aspect
we've just about used up our time here
that's what always amazes me
people get very upset
dallas has a guy
just all different colors
use those facilities quite often
i mean he's doing all right
not just in quantity
i work at a bakery
being a mini van
in terms of motivation and incentive
it's like you listen to bush
we're both school teachers
i don't know why i never registered it
when you're first married or starting out
it just depends on what kind they are
at the craft shop
how long did that movie run
or maybe twenty dolls
my husband does the same thing
i haven't had to replace the thing yet
not all the time
that's awful
you're not old
i've never been up there
some good books that i've read
there's some different things
those are running
pretty much the end of may
i don't get that
no there's no way
well maybe that is another factor
so you go back and visit with her anyway
it's not clear to me that it is really a problem
i've used a substantial amount of shareware
his daddy owned a boat shop
if you let one little law get through
including rural districts
the child's love and security
they don't like that
carry it over to there
made payments on our things
always home by the time you got home
will you help me with my homework
if he can keep that correlation together
you would dust every day
and of course sometimes they rent movies
it is frightening
i enjoyed our discussion
haven't had any parakeets for quite a while
that hadn't crossed my mind
doing the sentencing
at least into kindergarten
it comes down to a one word against the other
when they do go out
the marching band
they didn't have any time doing it the first time
now we get channel fifty five
changing the plugs and stuff
they have a new one now
how long you been in san antonio
i forget which way we do it
he's an interesting person
without me working
i like just looking at the billboards
their mother was sick at times
that's probably a major one
you don't need to drag it down the hall
we found a real good interest rate
it's kind of hard
it's really made such a difference for her
i just pretend they're not there
i don't get any of that bull
if this would be helpful
an exotic pet shop out in california
is it like a foreign exchange type student
elected not to do so
they were great men
replace some of the belts
the great audience
plastic and paper
it took me back to the sixties
little things like that
what i have to do
you either pay the thing off or they come get it
without any warning whatsoever
substantial amounts of money
that's the way they suck you in
the kids in that class
i'm a practicing vegetarian
with the jury actually making the verdict
my husband is a movie fanatic
there's still a big question in my mind
i really miss them
thirty to fifty pages a day
that is a hugh difference
to the top the of the peak
the children love them
i remember learning how to ski
we have some more that need to be done
he went to move in with another girl
they were showing some and i was watching
they don't have oil or anything
we're going to try and have her stay home
the blue mesa grill
it's not that he can't do it
since they don't have the yearly fee
i don't know how valid it is
it's more efficient to do things yourself
what are dialing services
is that portland
i really like it a lot
i think we used it for christmas
that's what you do with a catfish
having people file fewer claims
it was dirty
i've not had to exchange any other parts recently
not total but just from cars
i'm trying to learn how to cook
i had a similar thing
correspondence school
i know teachers are just like everybody else
he'll be delighted
he graduated and went off to college
he never really got in a game
it's the glasses
i hadn't even thought of that
i wanted him to win best actor on top of it
we don't get to do it
what do they call it
a threat one way or another
that's the way i am
she has high cholesterol
a new employee every six months
we feed the catfish
i'm only twenty two
the water was murky
i think it's getting better
you all have much trouble up there
thirty or forty points
they could have had a lottery
i know why i love a stick shift
they just need to do something with him
are you married
so the doctor elected to have her
you must know him
i can't think of which one it was
i sell family products
i'm not saying that they were
it's something that interests me
you have to have the picturesque kitchen
he's someone different
there's nothing to do
there is a guy in dallas
they might have five hundred troubled youths
there is a vast variety here
that's something that grows like a weed here
i think that that's probably true
should have expected it
we need a winner in this town
really expensive
from your point of view
i can't remember what the name of the lake is
the door bell rang
i would not mind it
to kill somebody is what it amounts to
it's hard with two
about four thousand
i have some friends that have children
do you play the piano
that's right
i would think that it's a pretty calm city
my children brought it to my attention
i'm allergic to grass
these kids work really hard
they had a centennial here awhile back
despite all of our open space out here
certainly if you wash it any amount of time
the teacher's in the middle
commercial television these days
i could use a card too
i don't know if they decided to do
what do you find that you use yours mostly for
this particular card
i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline
want to spend the money for it
this was a long time ago
they will kill you
essentially anything you find in a house
there's another aspect of this
they hold it up to the sun god
just because it only takes a few minutes to cook
three weeks after
it's about two hundred people
television is my main news source
this was twenty years ago
it doesn't really balance out too much
do you have to pay for that
they buy them from you
at an entirely different bank
this woman just offered it to me
i like it here
he was a courier
it's hard for me to
i'd like to be sporty
boy wouldn't i give to get
because it wouldn't make any sense
your body's not going to look as bad
that's kind of the way i feel
i just signed up for it
i really miss them a lot
that sounds like fun
go to the different composers
i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
i was going to do it
they may be able to
i have had shrimp
see any results of it the next day
they lay on these little mats
you're giving the foundations of the nation
studying electronic technology
because they've had their way of life
be careful you don't get stung
i'm kind of the opposite
they were pleading insanity
it's like a mill
that would be fine
it's already done for you
my voting experience
everything had a little bit of curry in it
they have this world football league
i think we are progressing at a snail's pace
we are as susceptible a society as anybody else
it just makes stuff move down
as far as i'm concerned he could
they really hit that ball
i'm looking for something
i work for a government contractor
you really want some suspense
have a family
looks like we're it now
do you go by the ads when you look at them
he's heading off
now can she leave
haven't been to one for a little while
i do other things very well
he had been in that position for years
did he go into that in the book
the recession
i don't know about your part of the country
i had someone tell me that
do you know where you're going
it was on his way of going downhill
you set your brake
did you have to do that
we do it all i really think that
our immigration history
i think in some cases
