football is an exciting part of
i'm glad it's on

i can put it in a day a
very well and a
well same box a
the tree was so project a

where did you get this look back a
is in the case of evil a
without the people it's under a
all we that next week a
we do as a matter of fact the
i have some games a
we're going to feel it worked out a
the news is a good way to keep up to date a
but back in the past a
just walking the streets a
he did not want to be in it any more than i did a
the teacher had eleven kids so
we were most civil liberties a
like here to join went a
that are in a into politics a

the is is that you emily is going down the
what do you write for them to
our pen of you a
the lot we lived in is now a chance a
for your next vehicle do you want a like a
it's all traditional looking a

my inlaws listen to the kind of music i hate
and on your computer or television is
and we play out here in the summertime it
it never did run right again did
you are really excited to
especially the ones that came out and said the place
be an expert to you know a
we little one want a
for me it was a
it looks like they've got a women in
but you don't know that it
i noticed something interesting last time i
they won't have to do
do you just like home cooking so
so it seems to be a
the decision to set the article in
they all for employment cases so
it would just depend
i like just sitting in
they've got the full weight room in
you had to have a pool to
that's neat that you like cross stitch and all do
the minute i had to come and do
my three year old son
just not feasible you know a
i can't really think of anything else a friend in
i'm not sure how to go about it is
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group
it was a cordless phone so
but it's kind of hard to
you can do so much with them so
my still get got a minute by the store and it
it was like four hundred times as much a
it's mostly done in
i would feel that i had the right to do
you just called him tracks a
i know the is
it's really hard make a
the experience did
do we have to wait until all the land fill
really scary to me is
i think it is getting worse but
i would like to see them do well i
i don't live in a house a
people put them in a
it can come away fast enough and go hide a
for about two hundred dollars a
in that time frame a
trying to make it through that day
anything like that we decided is
seven years in the pros is
many years or so ago
i think it does help it
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even these buses a
take your sick leave a
it's been kind of scary a
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often i
it took four days a
the pros and cons of both do
we're so bad
you get program and
not that i like waiting a
i think a cap for to do
i don't mean to be knocking a
i'd like to see those a
a controlled happening is
real close is
i guess he's trained in this is
it might be kind of tricky it
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
do you have friends with older children so
one had more pull to it
i just file federal income tax every year
i grew up on a farm a
that was the one that's been really nice to have
they've done it before a
the engine was pretty good a
how different the people there really are i
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so i do
that's fine with been a
i make that once in a while a
how to do things a
i typically am not a cat person i
the junk mail that you get a day
they put him in the nurse's office i
since this time last year i've changed a
they didn't put together a
i seem to know what he was doing a
they just live in the community a
it had to be given anyway i
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance pay for the body damage i
one is eight and one is eleven i
i was drug tested a
you neighbors and developing companies
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never painted the outside the
that's how we got started a
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful a
more people aren't a
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it a
you have to have a pretty good game i
there's small little trucks and cars like that i
they don't have the ability to develop it i
you got to have a one tenth indicator
there's so much going on here a
the victim's family and things just
being one of these late in life mothers a
the drug dealers a
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left i
they're gone now i
i have never skied before a
i don't know what we're going to do a
it's second nature
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many
it's like a buffet run by a
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate a
the next morning you want to take them out a
if the news we're getting is any good i
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any a
how to chase each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much i
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference in
i was born in texas and i read other areas a
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers
i guess i haven't had that much experience a
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them is
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice a
i didn't know too much about it a
my son plays football a
see how the family liked it a
one in college always a
were his civil rights violated so
it looks like it would be a
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want top in my line i
we can keep that out of our minds a
from for his country business a
we are doing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person a
i don't make that much do
it's been a long time a
no one can live on house
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
it seems like they would be able to do
they didn't find the car
she's one of those that loves a
now i i have to say it though uh uh
mostly with adolescents do
i'm not a carpenter or anything like that
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
to our class
basically a lot just
do you enjoy camping a
it's kind of a show piece
right down there a
how do you like your tread mill do
it was just too perfect at all times to
their self and and is wrong too
it is pretty okay
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up to a
was it six weeks old
fifteen feet wide
to a bigger city
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue a
when you found out who it was a a
because they been going to school a
they will up a
have you ever been drug tested a
he could get hurt
i'm originally a texan
you you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit too
i know a girl
we've got to get most of the time to do
to the place of what a be a a
even in my case a
can do whatever they want to do
because you doing it is
a little more flexibility is
they even looked halfway decent did
food prices did
i think the decision has been made a
they are not sure of themselves so
two kinds of the same kind of
he doesn't really pay attention to
if you're ever looking for that does
or you own conclusions does
that's from the child's standpoint is
there is no commercial for a decision to
golden retriever does
just get so worn down does
the same time you say it is
i mean you can earn a lot more money a
but at that point i was too far gone a
his face was really ground out by the kid a
i didn't know it did
that was a great little car do
over a very long period of time i
started investigating a
the presence of companies do
i wasn't opposed to paying for it a
to upholster chairs does
there are lobby do
we see more and more women being involved in
i have to make this one last as long as i can
only to the airport do
well tell me this is
that would be really awful do
question and answer period is
because you don't know a
for in the red wine and back to a boil do
i'll turn the radio on in
they say if you're not call in this line a
that's the way i feel too
what happened to get us to this point is
rome has said there was no collusion a
it was a great deal speaking with their do
i had the opposite so
we sit around and eat parking so
i don't have boys just
that would have been best time to go to
if they didn't have to do
that's certainly true a
you tell me your attention so
we have that here too
usually busy fighting for survival just
i've had so many people do
i don't even get to see half my project
we put some papers on the floor so
that's the closest thing the
kind of funny actually just
it was was the park i guess so
pop up really does
you're with the home office now too
they seem to be economically giving all
that be a really good thing to do
too much business just
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program a
even though they're too close to
doing his money a
i had never seen anything so
this week people started a
used to be six bucks a
i caught a group a
i feel so silly a
are they all here in the area a
i kind of look at it this way i
public marketing is
sewing and quilting just
good to hear from you do
where oklahoma city is
i read a lot and and i know people do
did you pull them a
that would make me happy to go
it's nice to get out in the open here a
i think it would do something for it to
it has really been nice here in
it's the rent dollars
it works out real nice to
we've had lot of them in the past it
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it
it's depressing to go
i don't own my home just
i've always wondered how he gets around a
it's just stuff
fiction books that i really like
you got any more to
i'm beginning to think it's not a
that's something i miss quite a bit too
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good together as a team a
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to sell it
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of our fish
sometimes it will stop it
i just don't like that it
usually going to talk about a
i am close to return my single degree
everything to enjoy it
he made a real big take himself
they actual wait for them to
it was for a murder trial
are you a professional musician do
it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program is
two sets of grandparents do
i call and find out
you want salary too but what do
i've heard about him
we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for she's a
they were okay
to find a band a
on a working time a
after we had them for several years a
if they work at it a little bit a
we don't have enough to
what are you making a
absolutely nothing a
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music a
we like mexican food a
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times a
you've got to find an even line so
i think he really makes it a
where you got the buy a
it all starts to become similar to
i could go along with that a
it's like one second of recording a
that's a big thing with me the
i'm the only one a
i've been following through on that a
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best do
i don't think too many of them are anymore a
how do you feel about your game so
when i lived out in the country
i'm originally from maine a
to grow up and to do what they want to do so
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends do
i've worked in hotels a
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry no
the engine blew up in it
they are for it too much so
i don't have a lot of time so
i know they will go
sometimes they're not very huh uh
we're sort the bottom do
i make a lot of my christmas presents a
we were talking about that just the other day a
in the houston area a
i'm not counting on it
i like to have somebody come with me to
was also kind of tough to
not sure that's something i want to do to
most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july a
i just get a been any money
the news or something in
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
he has should a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing i
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm getting from that the
from you are your thing in about four hours a
what's going to happen
i only weigh sixteen way too
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something uh
if they don't have any living relatives do
i watch the news on display a
worker of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to compare it to a
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was better than a
i want them to come back next year
does that when i was a kid
things that are under state recession
i was an administrator a
i don't have a lot of time to do it a
and i'm up here a
i enjoy them coming in
but it is a pretty low crime rate a
big closet space
you're welcome to go some place else
i would offer a
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different so
we'd have to build less prisons a
light reading a
well we just started a
we started taking her a
my mother and i were a
we are so busy so
i'd like to go bird hunting in
sometimes you have to ask them for that it
then do it all over again a
what do you think are some current trends in
about a thousand bad checks a
do you watch star trek a
so you don't have to put it down a
i don't see much t v mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and stay in
i don't get too many of those now
did they do that before he went in or right now
i'm getting rid of this car a
i have three cats and a dog a
they don't need that seven day waiting period so
of course it's real convenient a
my husband and i both went a
you learn more about the actors and stuff a
just a little shell to go on a shirt
then we put our receipts in there and
where is it going to be a
fifty nine kilometers per gallon in
they said it early a
it shouldn't be decide so
chemical services to come a
which which i thought was a real any occasion
well that's about it really a
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
