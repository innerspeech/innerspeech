recent legislation a
i'm a car buff too
a pain from a grateful heart

the only other place i've ever vacation
i just kind of went through
this is renovating first we need

guess they all grew up in new york city
you make such a choice
but they have snakes over there
a good positive direction

i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon
it's a celebration type of company
i work out of my home
the way it works
it doesn't have an air conditioner
then you have to make a salad
loving the bible in the equation
i read in the paper
i'm in the peace processes business
once every year or two

i've been tried and true
i think that's something we might want
she thought for a few minutes
that is a sad situation
they do have capital punishment
it was nice talking to you ugly
my favorite team is the rangers
kind of goes along with what you were saying
why they don't go with person one
we just award
we are the detroit delicate
he went to vietnam one man and came back another
as any city grows up
so you did buy a pattern
it's about six and a half percent
i agree with the phone
so i think it's going to be a lot easier
not too much soy sauce
we take a certain portion of your basic
who sponsors you
and i don't know what's going to happen
i think we have about thirteen months left on it
i do particularly find it annoying
they have clubs and a swimming pool
our point of view
it really is worth while to sew
i thought that was a little incentive
public transportation
vocal point
i run on and on about
what are we doing
my job tends to be very demanding
you know it was just in just
and most people like that are old
that's what i was doing before
the best teachers and the best students
i don't like it cold
she was inaugurated in january

competition with demand
it still makes most of it's profit in asia
i think that is important too
have a good evening
and finally we tend to make these occasion
he didn't eat flies
most of the time they don't bother with it
they didn't keep it so i got it back
i'm sure all the lakes are in it
the family issues that we discuss
a lot of the trees moving southward
when disclosure isn't enough
contact points
this morning it was twenty nine

increasingly democratically and
something a little extra
i kind of wish that they had a little like for the boys
killer bee anything
i hadn't heard about that
the ability of people to asses health care
that's probably one of the reasons
quite a few movies are based off of that
but when i went home that's all i could think about
i'm north of that actually
a couple kids on here under
it was something easy i could do
i think why a lot of people go to west virginia
brown and black patches of fur
the jury is expected to end it's decision
somebody points
i don't get to watch
well all money now a
available at more
room and everything

there is some definite talking in her apart
i maybe local times in tooling many based on work
the new york take some place the mail
when we were in high school it was always fun
she knows how to do that

i have to think about it some more now
i was really kind of excited to start reading
what are you say

i enjoyed it very much
he had occasion on her mother money
and all versions of this title
you might and be able to get a job there
enjoyable to use
we came to a fork in the wood at night
he really likes it and i don't
it's nice in small
i think there is confusion
i go someplace for the day
but they're going to learn it sometime
it was the big one
it's kind of a depressing topic
every six months i have to pay my taxes
i never been sailing
i have six years of college
and then the like one down is in the parent
enjoy the adventure
not lately though
too many city problems for the long term
are there any other countries or said you done in exploiting
yes i still miss what they call a full timer
for family and
do you know that i've never seen a monkey
i know both people
i recommend the hunter to a lot of people
do you have a computer for yourself at home
it's the original
you can blame them
more choice more can ability
i guess traffic could be an annoyance
we've gone for meeting food and lebanese food
i had to dust and clean
football is an exciting sport
i'm glad it's done
i don't know the details
when you make more about the system of treasury us inflation
too many horror stories out there
every major city has a theatre
go to the zoo and see elephant and dogs and things like that
it was kind of fun
that appeared to be eight or nine years old
i'm kind of out of it right now
i don't not would ever in the paper
my brother can do it
not everybody shows up
even have with them out of the neighbor line
it was just based on the facts
wasn't it your state that had police involved
did you actually you train at all
i don't have too much either
i can put it in a day
we will spread
the same box
the tree was so present
i'm reading starts
you have some fishing time
where do you get this trick back
vision in the case of evil
without the visual it isn't
all we that next week
we do as a matter of fact
i have some times
we're going to feel it worked out
the news is a good way to keep up to date
point blank in the face
just walking the street
he did not want to be in it any more than i did
the teacher had eleven kids
we were payment civil liberties
like here to join penalty
not for instance in politics
don't let them see violence at home
the issue is that you family is going out
what do you write for them
or any of you
that that we is in is now a point
do you next vehicle do you want a truck
it's all traditional looking
they pass your phone number on to another company
they had sixty four of them
well i like the seventies
this is frozen as elevation
it's probably going to be a real old news and
enjoy your day
the mental house to raise them
friday afternoon at five three
make it a measure last year
i mean a large flat plate
i'd like to see it be more of an empty part
all of our tin cans
paying more often than usual
capital punishment
everyone knows they're going to get it
my in a listen to the kind of music i hate
and on your money are television
and we play out here in the summertime
it never did run right again
you are physically exploited
especially the ones that came out and said the place
we are expected to you know
we later on want
to me appears
it looks like they've got a weapon
but you don't know that
i noticed something innocent last time
they won't have to
do you go like home cooking
so it seems to be
the decision to center the article
as well for employment cases
it would just depend
i like this setting
they've got the full weight room
you had to have a play
that's neat that you like cross stitching all
the men i had to come and
my three year old
that's not feasible you know
i can't really think of anything else offend
i'm not sure how to go about it
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group
it was a cordless phone
but it's kind of hard
you can do so much with them
my still get got a minute by the story
it was like four hundred times as much
it's probably done
i would feel that i had the right to
you just call him tracks
i know there is
it's really hard may
the experience
you have to wait until all the land fill
really scary to me
i think it is getting worse
i really would like to see them do well
i don't live in a house
people put them in
it can swim away fast enough and go hide
for about two hundred dollars
in that time frame
trying to make it through that
anything like that we justified
seven years in the pros
many years or so
i think it does help
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even these buses
take your sick leave
it's been kind of scary
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often
it took four days
the pros and cons of both
we're so bad
you get programming
not that i like rating
i think a cup or two
i don't mean to be knocking
i'd like to see those
a controlled substance
all close
i guess he's trained in this
it might be kind of story
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
do you have friends with older children
one had more pull to it
i just file federal income some tax every year
i grew up on a farm
that was the one that's been really nice to have
they've done it before
the engine was pretty good
how different the people there really are
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so
that's mine was fun
i make that once in a while
how to do things
i typically am not a cat person
the junk mail that you get
they put him in the nursery office
since this time last year i've changed
they didn't fight together
i seem to know what he was doing
they just live in the company
it had to be eleven anyway
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance paid for the pretty damage
one is eight and one is eleven
i was drug tested
true but and development company
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never painted the outside
that's how we got started
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful
more people want
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it
you have to have a pretty good team
they're small little trucks and cars like that
they don't have the ability to develop it
you got to have a one tenth indicator
there's so much going on here
the victims' families and things
being one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers a
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
they're gone now
i have never skied before
i don't know what we're going to do
it's second nature
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many
it's like a but gone by
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate a
the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
how to see each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much to
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was one in six and i read other areas
i guess because i work quite a bit with i
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i didn't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college always
were his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be a
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want stop in my own
we can keep that out of our minds
from her his country business
we are doing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time
no one can live on ice
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
it seems like they would be able to
the didn't find the car
she's one of those that loves
now i just have to face it though
mostly with adolescents a
i'm not a carpenter or anything like that
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
to our class to
basically a lot
do you enjoy camping
it's kind of a show piece
but down there too
how do you like your tread mill
it was just too perfect at all times
their self and is wrong
it is pretty okay to
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up
was it six weeks old too
having it would
you're a bigger c
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
when you find out who it was
because they been going to school
they will up to
have you ever been drug tested
he could get hurt
i'm originally a texan
so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit
i know a girl
we've got to get most of the time
to the price of what to buy
even in my case i do
can do whatever they want
because you own it
a little more flexibility
they even like every distant
a food processor
i think the decision has been made
they are not sure of themselves
two sides of the same coin
he doesn't really pay attention
if you're ever looking for that
are you on conclusions
that's from the child's standpoint
there is no sample for a decision
children river
nurses get so worn down
the sick time you see it
i mean you can earn a lot more money
but at that point i was too far gone
his face was really ground out by the crowd
i didn't know it
that was a great little car
over a very long period of time
trade investigating
the presence of companies
i want people to pay for it
to upholster chairs
they are lovely
we see more and more women being involved
i have to make this one last as long as i can
only to the airport
well tell me this
that would be really awful
question and answer period
because you don't know
for in the red wine and bring to a boil
i'll turn the radio on
they say if you're not call in this line
that's the way i feel
what happened to get us to this point
some is said there was no collusion
it was a great pleasure speaking with you
i had the opposite
we sit around and eat something
i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go to
if they didn't have to do
that's certainly true
to develop your attention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to say have my project
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the back i guess
a pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be economically driven also
that would be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're so close
doing his money
i had never seen anything
this week people started
used to be take back
i caught a cop
i feel so silly
are they all here in the area
i kind of look at it this way
public broken
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
through oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open air
i think it would do something for it
it has really been nice here
it's the rent dollars
it works out real nice
we've had lots of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left out in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't want my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just stuff
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm going to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good deal as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to fall
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of our fish
sometimes it will take
i just don't like that
social taking to talk about
i am close to receiving my english degree
everything to answer
he made a real big take himself
they're actual ready for them
it was for a murder trial
are you a professional musician
it's far beyond me
we've made an awful lot from the space program
two sets of grandparents
i call and find out
you want salary to us right
i've heard about him too
we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for choice
they were okay
to find a button
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making a
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up their time
other he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of magic
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he really makes it
where you get the boy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i live out in the country
i'm originally from me
to grow up and to do what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the armed forces did so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very home
we sort the bottom to
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not counting on it
i like to have somebody come with me to a
was also kind of tough
not sure that's something i want to do
most of the stores will except those a a
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
will be true in a guy to a
i just that it's been any money
the news or something i
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
he has used a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm guessing from that
seems to a you're saying in about four days
it's going to happen
i only very second away
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any living relatives a
i watched the news on it for a
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to compare it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was faster than a
i want them to come back up next year
does that when i was a kid
things that are under state jurisdiction
i was an ad but i
i don't have a lot of time to do it
when i'm up here i
i enjoy them coming to a
but it has a pretty low crime rate
big closet space
they're welcome to go some place else i
i wait offer
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different
we'd have to build less prisons
light reading
well we just start a
we started taking her
my mother and i were
we are so busy
i'd like to go bird hunting
sometimes you have to ask them for that e
then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends e
about a thousand bad checks
do you watch star trek
so you don't have to put it down
i don't see much t v mostly when i'm in school i
they could probably come in and t e
i don't get too many of those
did they do that be he went in or what i
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period to
of course it's real convenient
my husband and i both went to
you learn more about the sectors and stuff
just a little shell to go on a suit a
then we put our receipts in there too
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers per gallon
they did it early
it shouldn't be destroyed
chemical services to come
which which i thought was a real entry question
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's still not enough for a total
one thing led to another
you different parts of the country
i didn't have any some friends to speak of
it really have those people
put a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for you in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot fairly people did
they think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i don't know how my father did it
lived on a farm for six years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
curling and gas
the commercial districts
that's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
passing in and
they plastered over drywall
i'll slice white grapes
the time element
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how she got it
you're decision important
getting back seat for the state
if you have any doubts whatsoever
literary movie
i can't remember where
