it was like four hundred times as much
it's possibly fun
i would feel that i had the right to

how different the people there really are
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so
that's buying with one
i make that once in a while
how to do things
i typically am not a cat person
the junk mail that you get
they put him in the nursery off
since this time last year i've changed

a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful
more people want
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it
you have to have a pretty good game
they're small little trucks and cars like that
they don't have the ability to develop it
you got to have a one tenth indicator
there's so much going on here
the best of family and things
being one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
they're gone now
i have never skied before
i don't know what we're going to do
it's second nature

we don't get to see too many
it's like a but gone by
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate
the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
how to see each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was born in texas and i read other years
i guess because i work quite a bit with our
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
training money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i didn't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college always
we're his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want stop in my lawn
we can keep that out of our minds
from for his degree business
we are doing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time
no one can live on ice
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie

i'm originally a texan
to you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit
i know a girl
you've got to eat most of the time
to the price of what a base
even in my case
can do whatever they want
because you running it
a little more flexibility
they even look halfway decent
food prices
i think the decision has been made
they are not sure of themselves
two sides of the same coin
he doesn't really pay attention
if you're ever looking for that
are you on conclusions
that's from the child's standpoint
there is no time tables for a decision
children we save
just get so worn down
the sick time you see it
i mean you can earn a lot more money
but at that point i was too far gone
his face was really round out by the crowd
i didn't know it
that was a great little car
over a very long period of time
i'd investigating
the presence of companies
i wasn't opposed to paying for it
to upholster chairs
they are lovely
we see more and more women being involved
i have to make this one last as long as i can
only to the airport
well tell me this
that would be really awful
question and answer period
because you don't know
for in the red wine and bring to a boil
i'll turn the radio on
they say you're not call in this line
that's the way i feel
what happened to get us to this point
trump has said there was no collusion
it was a great deal speaking with their
i had the opposite
we sit around and eat something
i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go
if they didn't have to
that's certainly true
to develop your attention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to say have my magic
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the park i guess
a pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be economically driven also
that would be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're so close
during his money
i had never seen anything
this week people started
use to be sick back
i caught a group
i feel so silly
are they all here in the area
i kind of look at it this way
public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
they're oklahoma city
i read a lot and when i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open here
i think it would do something for it
it has really been nice here
it's the rent dollars
it worked out real nice
we've had lots of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left out in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just stuff
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm going to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good together as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to sell
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of our fish
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
social training to talk about
i am close to reading my single agree
everything to enjoy
he made a real big take himself
they actual read for them
it was for a murder trial
are you a professional musician
it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program
two sets of grandparents
i call and find out
you want quality to most what
i've heard about him
we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for sure
they were okay
to find a man
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you get the buy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i lived out in the country
i'm originally from me
to grow up and to do what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the armed forces did so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very open
we're hard the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not counting on it
i like to have somebody come with me
was always kind of tough
not sure that's something i want to do
most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just that it's been any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
he has did a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm guessing from that
since you are your think in about four now
it's going to happen
i only way chicken today
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any living relatives
i watched the news on c
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to compare it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was better than
i want them to come back up next year
does that when i was a kid
things that are under state fiction
i was an animal
i don't have a lot of time to do it
when i'm up here
i enjoy them coming
but it has a pretty low crime rate
big closet space
they're willing to go some place else
i write software
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different
we'd have to build less prisons
light reading
well we just started
we started taking her
my mother and i were
we are so busy
i'd like to go bird hunting
sometimes you have to ask them for that
then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad checks
do you watch star trek
so you don't have to put it down
i don't see much v mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and see
i don't get too many of those
did they do that be he went in or not
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three kids and a dog a
they don't need that seven day waiting period i
of course it's real convenient
my husband and i both went
you learn me about the taxes and stuff
just a little shell to go on a shirt
then we put a rip in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers per gallon
they need it early
it shouldn't be decide
capital services to come
which which i thought was a real any question
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm crucial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's just not enough for a total
one thing led to another
two different parts of the country
i don't have any job benefits to speak of
it really helps those people
but a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for years in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot more people did
they think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i don't know how my father did it
lived on a farm for six years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
ceiling and gas
the commercial strict
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
they might as well
savings and loan
they plastered over drywall
i'll slice white grapes
the from element
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how you got it
your vacation reimbursement
