they put him in the nurses office

how to chase each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was born in texas and i read other areas
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i didn't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college always
were his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing

i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go
if they didn't have to
that's certainly true
use of ellen for attention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the back i guess

public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you

it's just tough
fiction books that i really like

i'm going to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's why i didn't think about that
good deal as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to follow
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of our face
sometimes it will shape
i just don't like that

on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you get the boy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been calling through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i live out in the country
i'm originally from mean
to grow up and to degree what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've work in a tile
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry

the arm force it so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they well
sometimes they're not very open
we're sort the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not counting on it

most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just get it's been any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day so
a girl and a boy
he has used a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm guessing from that
same here uh you think in about four hours
it's going to happen
i only wear section away
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any living relatives
i watch the news on c
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to agree it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this a casual then

things that a under state or section
i was an animal

i've heard different
we'd have to build less prisons
light reading
well we just started

then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad takes
do you watch star trek
no you don't have to but it down

did they do that be he went in or what
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period
of course it's real convenient

then we put a crisp in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers for killing
they need it early
it shouldn't be decide
commercial services to come
which i thought was a real entry question
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's just not enough for a whole
one thing led to another
you different part of the country
i didn't have any job benefits to speak of
it really up those people
but a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for you in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot really people did
they think it's kind of cool
some is too much
i didn't know how my father did it
live on a farm for sixty years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of on the friends
i never even knew that
curling and grass
the commercial trucks
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
having and and
they plastered over it well
all class white grapes
the time element
on the outskirts of houston

your baron reimbursement
cutting back seat for the prostate
if you have any doubts whatsoever
literary movies
