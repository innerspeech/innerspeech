the news is a good way to keep up to date
point back in the past
just walking the street
he did not want to be in it any more than i did
the teacher had eleven kids
we were promised civil liberties
look how to done differently
letters or insight into politics
don't let them see violence at home
the issue is that you employee is going down to

we really one want
summer because
it looks like they've got a weapon
but you don't know that
i noticed something innocent last time
they won't have to
do you go like home talking
so it seems to be
the decision to sit the article
they will for employment cases
it would just depend
i like last setting
they've got the full weight room
you had to have a polite
that's neat that you like cross stitch and all
the minute i had to come in
my three year old
just not feasible you know
i can't really think of anything else offhand
i'm not sure how to go about it
it's very tedious if you have a whole group
it was a cordless phone
but it's kind of hard
you can do so much with them
my still get got it by the period
it was like four hundred times that much
it's mostly done
i would feel that i had the right to
you just call him tracks
i know there is
it really hurts me
the experience
you have to wait until all the land fill
very clear to me
i think it is getting worse
i would like to see them do well
i don't live in a house
people put them in
it can from where fast enough and go hide
for about two hundred dollars
in that time frame
trying to make it through that
anything like that we just
seven years in the polls
twenty years or so
i think it does help
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even this basis
take your sick life
it's been kind of degree
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often
it took four days
the pros and cons of both
we're so bad
you get some camping
not that i like getting
i think a cup or two
i don't mean to be knocking
i'd like to see those
a controlled substance
well close
i guess you trained on this
it might be kind of tacky
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
do you have friends with older children
one and more fall to it
i just file federal income tax every year
i grew up on a farm
that was the one that's been really nice to have
i've done it before
the end was pretty good
how different the people there really are
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so
since brian was born
i make that once in a while
how to do things
i typically am not a cat person
the junk mail that you get
they put him in the nurse's office
since this time last year i've changed
they didn't fight together
i seem to know what he was doing
they just live in the community
it had to be given anyway
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance pay for the body damage
one is eight and one is eleven
i was drug tested
to neighbors and developing companies
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never painted the outside
that's how we got started
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful
more people want
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it
you have to have a pretty good team
there's small little trucks and cars like that
they don't have the ability to develop it
you got to have a one tenth indicator
there's so much going on here
the digging family and things
playing one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
they're gone now
i have never skied before
i don't know what we're going to do
it's second nature
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many
it's like a bullet gone by
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate
the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
just to chase each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was one in texas and i read other years
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i don't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college always
were his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want top in my lawn
we can keep that out of our mind
from for his photography business
we are seeing that here as well
that's would made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time
so one can live on us
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
it seems like they would be able to
just didn't find the car
she's one of those that loves

mostly with adolescents

i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
to our class

it's kind of a show piece
i'm not down there
how do you like your tread mill

their self and and is wrong
it is pretty okay
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up

fifteen feet wide
for a bigger city
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
when you find out who it was
because they big gone to school
they will up
have you ever been drug tested
he could get hurt
i'm originally a texan
so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit
i know a girl
you've got to eat most of the time
to the price of what a buy
even in my case
can do whatever they want
because you running it
little more flexibility
they even like safety distant
food pricier
i think the decision has been made
they are not sure of themselves
two sides of the same coin
he doesn't really pay attention
if you have looking for that
are you on conclusions
that's from the kid in point
there is no comparable for a decision
golden retriever
justice gets to run down
the take time you see it
i mean you can earn a lot more money
but at that point i was too far gone
his voice was really found out by the crowd
i didn't know it
that was a great little car
over a very long period of time
crud investigating
the presence of companies
i wasn't opposed to paying for it

guns an answer period
because you don't know
for in the red one and bring to a boil
i'll turn the radio on
they say if you not call in this line
that's the way i feel
what happened to get us to this point
from has said there was no collision
it was a great pleasure speaking with you
i heard the opposite
we sit around and eat pocket
i don't have boys
that would have been my time to go
if they didn't have to
that's certainly true
you division your attention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
if it so many people
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor
that's the last thing
kind of funny actually
it it was the back i guess
a pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be exactly giving all
that would be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're so close
one is money
i had never seen anything
this week people hearted
used to be six bucks
i caught a cop
i feel so silly

i kind of look at it this way
public run
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
through oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy to
it's nice to get out in the open here
i think it would do something for it
it is really been nice here
get the grant cause
it worked out real nice
i've had lot of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just tough
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm beginning to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good deal as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's not going to fall
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of our fish
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
social going to talk about
i am close to ready in my english degree
everything's still inches
he made a real big take himself
they actual wait for them
it was for a murder trial
are you a professional musician
it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program
two sets of conformance
i call and find out
you want salary too but what
i've heard about him
you've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for choice
they were okay
to find a man
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up this time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you got the buy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i live out in the country
i'm originally from maine
you grow up and to a guy what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can guess i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the time we did so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very open
we're sort the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the ocean here
i'm not garden on it
i like to have somebody come with me
was also kind of tough
not sure that's something i want to do
most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just what it's been any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day so
a girl and a boy
he has used a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm giving from that
some who you are sick in about four hours
it's going to happen
i only way second day
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any living relatives
i watch the news on tv
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties
i don't have much to agree it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was fresher then

things that are under state inspection
i was an admin c

when i'm up here
i enjoy them coming
but it has a pretty low crime rate
big closet space
they're welcome to go some place else
i write software
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different
we'd have to build less prisons
as light reading
well we just started
we started taking her
my mother and i were
we are so busy
i'd like to go out hunting
sometimes you have to ask them for that
then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad checks
do you watch star trek
so you don't have to put it down

they could probably come in and say
i don't get too many of those
did they do that be he went in or what
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that having day waiting period
of course it's real convenient
my husband and i both went
you learn me about the pictures and stuff
just a little shell to go on a suit
then we put our receipts in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers for killing
then seen it earlier
it shouldn't be destroyed
chemical service to come
which i thought was a real entering asian
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i know going to the mix and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
there are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was raised like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's just not enough for a total
one thing led to another
you draft part of the front
i didn't have any job printed to pick up
it really helps those people
but a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for you in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot very people did
i think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i didn't know how my brother did it
lived on a farm for sixty years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
following and guess
the commercial districts
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
they might as well
having an own
they plastered over darrell
i'll slice white grapes
the problem development
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how she got it
your passion is important
getting back seat for the most states
if you have any doubts whatsoever
literary movies
