take a bus or two or dress
many factor for nineteen seventy five
the water takes the reasons
because it's all she talked about
did you hear any press about that
i play in several symphony orchestras
i've heard on the news
maybe put in a little bit effort
and i guess it was late may
interstate collars a
the word of the confusion
and it evokes an emotional response
you want to buy something
that's basically what we do
i guess a lot of people do
a lot of people have well water
it seems like he would develop pride
but you not a
they make a collection on monday for yard waste
several of the countries

my grandmother's house a
i think the people will he certainly
i listen to the radio a
so it was really neat to
we want to stay forever
i know lots of women would do it all the time
it is very interesting to
i get calls at home a
i rely primarily on the train
they classify most of them as professionals
not even a dressy think
for the both of us
basic coverage for everyone
that will keep the bugs off them
i'm glad that there are still some areas that are great
time was of people to join the others
you have to support the people that are there
it's the hard work
from the community
no data points a
it's moving north a
i enjoy gardening a
technical decision
he's a pacific a
yeah my later one is classic cars
in fact the first year we were moved
they start each other a
the street and the see are cutting each other
i have have had to return something
my whole family is somewhat musical
he just turned forty
they haven't mass produced enough to do that
that's really important to
they all have air bags to
some wine tastings up in the valley a
how about investing in the sun
that will cut pollution to a
i understand what you're talking about
the detroit news oh
max version a
do they all have small children too
that was the point a
i would have been drafted
but i'm still going to college
and those are really helpful too
we also set aside money for entertainment
they should keep these people in prison
they're just sort of into clothes
there is a receptacle
we generally don't have those to do
well i enjoy singing
i really would like to have something like that
it's the culture in asia
is he the elementary school employee
they are totally debt free
i don't know if can do that or not
it was like i didn't belong anymore
i didn't see that
they weren't there by choice
the only thing were known for
they finally terms what the problem was
i hear mind saying no
we pass them on to us
nutritionally good for us
you told yourself
hundreds of reading all longer passing
i would contemplate going on a cruise now
enough with the general points
and then she goes to be school
she won't be an only child for long
that are causing problems
you're inviting the border
that's an individual thing
working in florida
i like to watch almost all football
me what your trainer the thing goes
the much was done and being at this point
she had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before
panels and things
was it a wednesday or thursday
take my mother in a nursing home
i don't think we should have access to those
it makes me sick
and invest in mall or station
my teacher looked at it every week
it's indication of cost would
such as the health field
my stepfather is dead
there was something on
if you see it smoking there's a problem
or that alive on monday
i was looking for the measurement
please enjoy
such an easy way to avoid tariffs
it was quite large
she was about eleven at the time
enjoy application
or maybe your daughter
we have to get rid of them all
they've done really well
i am also in the travel business
this event and area
what college are you teaching at
we only first down here in denver
little field trips or something
morally i don't like the idea
talking points
that's a real good
i can't remember what they said his name was
he agreed to be in it
good talking to you too
i heard it that time
not one instance
in the rivers and stuff
the nursing home that's just a mile from our house
it's sort of painful for a while
and that person would answer the question
i work so hard over the weekend
my husband and i are vegetarians
do you exercise
the television rights don't come out
measuring ownership
that's a lot of talent
i really miss it
five thirty and six thirty or something like that
it's not very inspiring
you probably have all kinds of trees
cruise has big decisions to make
enjoy live music
they're very popular around here
i think all women are going to work
and i need to keep that going
i'm concerned
i have got like noah's ark
and i always thought it was kind of out of fashion
don't they have a point
he didn't like pork chops
that it's a good system
i don't know how you can but that
i haven't really priced it out
illusion caught by rob
and i was expressing my frustrations
regime change
we've been trying
a high school course
so many factors
an airport departure tax
enjoy the best picture course
everything else
it was like contract work
that was really instruction
i don't get too many
my boyfriend won't mind
rental version
who was it during the last year
i hope you enjoyed this
and a very good afternoon to you
and i never had to pay for one
do you hate it more
we're never going to get that back
i have had serious questions all along
all allege democrats
i don't have a lot of time to read the decision
you would just pay a flat tax
you need to really work
so i didn't go then
i hear what you're saying
seems like a nice place to go
i think the ghost is in the house
and they should study it
they say the mail is really bad
done this week so
penalties and fines and punishment
you didn't have all the extra employees
our time will be up
but there are limit on racing coral to
that's just what it is
it is an central all of the cannabis plant
i don't care for that at all
tennis shoes and play goes
that is the hardest part probably
and leave the kids
they were out in my garage
i'm not for controlling how much is spent
business as usual
they're everywhere
they're pretty young
and the other direction
just go monkey boy
i'm going to pick up my family
given essential oil
on the better and get really x
nice isn't the word i'd choose
i mean the saturday night special stuff
that testing is a little bit too far
the education
doesn't tax me too physically
it wasn't really that important to me
even though i wasn't spending much money
and it's just incredible
a secretary to take messages for us or type
one of the things i did not like was the weapons
little fire the sunshine pastas book cars
the constitution doesn't apply
everything is equal and yet down there it's not
you know it's bound to spread
that's marvelous
it's funny but it's not
her mother was divorced at nineteen
i grew up in california
so many of my crafts are plant based
it will be better in june
i was working in the seventh
he would get angry
i really enjoy that team
a certain amount of the salary would go to it
i have a thirteen hundred dollar be
i'll let you go first
i'll give it a shot
never intend to have anything
the freshwater tank's just dirty
is it saved
we're not americans
all four have donation get point cars
we didn't disconnect
and i think it was okay
what would you like to do with your life
they thought it was the greatest fun
they did a good job
we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend
they didn't find any problem with that
it's still pretty cruel
you are going to get caught anyways
that maybe it's not necessary
someone to and a baby conclusion
quite a bit of speech work
well i guess this is it
boy is really bad
he has the same things that all my kids have
they had repaired it
move it once
it should be a mess
but at one point they're going to outgrow you
having the civil rights
but the son has finally got popping out
wise choice
they'll have a satellite camp in a month
only half of its employees with right
i'm live on the edge are even more unstable than usual
on the other hand
it is not all about innocent pleasures
the news division of the houston chronicle
that's a fun idea
took them about an hour
that's my field of work also
it's just such a bad time for it
i like classical music
somebody will say
it's as much reason as they can possibly do
take care of your little ones
but i just think dogs need you
and they always have surprises for you
persuasions are incredibly situational
i lean to that coverage
it last a long time
to get the positive part of it
don't wear their head off
they didn't cut us off
of course they pay them
it's my distinct pleasure
and the royals and thank them for that
i want to be able to get a car now and finance it
in the previous version
i don't even own a back
do you find yourself funny
more appeals means more points
i haven't been to a game since
it would be interesting to see how the data base changes
he's really come with answers
i had them enjoyed that side of it
it's like the old house
they should be enough choice
if you don't want to rough it too much
it's just part of miles from here
i can do enough damage with the two
undergraduate school
what's wrong with her voice
they sent us a little booklet
as a little bad you
what is that thing i saw
so i don't know what the point
it was written many years ago
that's a whole giving better
the choice is yours
it's up north
that's what i mean by work condition
but we don't fight over it or anything
i'm glad i'm not the one that first
don't fight against a power company
and i don't know why they do that
these guys want attention
of like a singing
really a rough time to know
so she don't her daughter in the classroom
if you play regular
some of them are formal two year programs
and i being a call yesterday
too noisy
our school garden
i'm hoping it will soon and
the question was more like check
there has to be some sort of buffer in there
we would or whatever
well i didn't know that
and we went to see kindergarten cop
an invitation
it's very serious just across the street
another thing that i have
i haven't bought it now for about eight years
were you the girl scouts
there's no smoking in any public areas
it had joined the class
it's disappointing how this was handled
that's maybe not so typical
you can get used to the weather
has a little bit of everything
i think we put too much on politicians
they plan on doing every summer
regime crimes as it were
i can't remember the guy's name
the ninety two percent
liberated it after a fire
you wouldn't believe it to
the house kind of sinking a little bit
he's really getting too old to take care of it
so what's the ferry down there
they always appear to hold well
but we didn't know it
my day is usually pretty full
about forty or fifty cents a pound
that they had to put in an n if it was a toy
a lot of them do go on
we've got some beets
they can always maybe get somebody else to cook
try and find some it's hard
i haven't had a chance
they she don't know what they were there for
i think was the question
colonel is in ithaca
well that sounds pretty
we went through it
have you seen ghosts yet
i'm embarrassed to say the last
it's been about five minutes
before they took off this time
a good appetite
they are used to the virginia area
i married into a military family
and you really begin to really an interest in it
knox is just over the hill here
it's what you want to be
when you have a barbecue
something on that level
it happened like year
the one person in the family you know all
i hear you have kids
it's really not too difficult
then you really get back to it
the street scene cost them four hundred
know where to draw a line
it's a beautiful home
he's just going off like he always has
i made some of them with regular work
it's not really a credit card
and most important into the journey of life
they learn such bad things in jail
do you live in pennsylvania
we have to do it in the family
this was an international
explore further massing water from space
that is a real cute show
are you a television store
it is really interesting
i think my favorite meal was a hamburger and fries
it seems like people just run in circle
i was one of the first to believe
i try to do some boating
after being truck she runs off in angry confusion and panic
the vines are really taking over
that's my favorite team
part of it is ancient technology
the corner has a crucial role in focusing vision
my phone is ringing
the new campaign has already died on nervous occasion
well bill
this is an unusual thing to measure and week can feel
he supposedly got this one usually
people run in the park at night
how did you get to know about the seizure
that's not really trying
then we decided to have kids
he can touch your hand
about twenty the years
you still see them committing the same crimes even with police overweight
the like is beautiful
it didn't have a closet or any large place
that sounds like less recent social changes
that kind of threw them off
sometimes when you watch a lot of that your brain turns off
the choice is yours
ninety seven cents a week
i'd pass by my high school teachers up at the store
but your group of friends is quite large
i've also driven one at a track event
that's never got to be the biggest thing on my mind
this to came on where these people had to survive in the wild
the best many of those are collision with building class
the reason behind the decision
it's a very expensive automobile
they mentioned that one only briefly
they did a survey of everybody
she hard a noise comes from the gym
it was really over priced
on any given day
that's why i like some variety in my breakfast food
how many employees work in the store
i like my garden too
are you happy with what you are doing now
either quick factory
none of your business
they have been a couple of times
all four have generational get point guards
it's just so versatile
were you here last summer
the fast moving water getting the air away
the first direction that i can hear is up ahead
it's a joy to build
to move version we have to make both version of well
it's really was something later on
we have a truck goal now
it's an incredible amount
in inches or centimeters
and you just like to your husband
play your cards right and make some good investment
it's probably not true that he couldn't make a decision
i'm really enjoying it
the air with the card is easy
it and how this was handled
something things a little nicer
i did not even get an apartment
it's really easy to swing in there for breakfast
i think the newsmen
my son in all love to cook
decided to vote in the last few years
those are like two of my most favorite flavor
contact point
a little closer to the edge
my cats do that too
it will always be on my radio
it's work letting you know
more is a crime
two very
what time do you go to the bathroom
they're extended
when was it
that's probably for two reasons
you're right across the street
it was a very close game
the only thing for us
we just got married
you think about work
avoiding the worst place for fabulous
it's more of a police action in itself
i watch your kid on the weekend
you other yourself to enjoy every step you take
he came last june and watched a game in the back room
so an actual live in that country for a while
it was a political move
they never will be
they worked a couple of shows like that
luckily the positive to measure the effect
and is pretty heavily on air rest
i don't want to do anything
you might just as well enjoy football
can have a lot of energy
visualize the character and create a mental picture
play it on on part of your lawn
the food comes out fish
which has less crime
my home is filled with joy year after year
i think those are awful
you a good many of current composite
we are really back not got used on large areas
you still got a perfectly good starter
what kind of print should i be
how big is the family you cook for
they really got something going this year
a lot of good has come from this one
i wouldn't want to eat cactus
she gave one just high of pretty as two different
course it was about nine o'clock at night
at that point in time
i told my husband
even out visual content to keep the audience engaged
there's a lot of crime
i'm going to go to sulphur springs
because of really constant
we to want to the conclusion
i made a bad decision
it doesn't seem very tall for a december
we want to see that one
two hundred hours of community service
let's see what else can we do
the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion
more classes for visual learner
he was just putting himself
avoid toxic relations
in the newspaper they have a little section
audience choice would
i think i'm going to look for that
see the changes as equally void
i'm your customer
the higher echelon
are you both from utah originally
i don't know how to
i'm on the phone
instead of six
we live in the country
i am not real big on guns
maybe not that long ago
why is this better for employees
i'm going out of town this weekend
the paid time off is wonderful
take the version by top this man
i can't talk i had chocolate
buy a type putting a second pointer
they don't get a lot of participation
lot of money spent on this
we used to always enjoy watching
that has been her dream
i watched some football
which way are you coming
i don't really care to go out and visit
it depends on the decision of the company
whether he is or not
that's in there now
shut of the television and say off the computer
robberies or things like that
to work in the summer
what are the problems with public education
some odd choices
none of them are too interested in current events
incompetent with respect to the material
because you've developed
there's an old saying about it
they're flying all over with it
it keeps you busy
i guess they get the name
one of these days when i get a new car
his voice was
she was on a carnival
every single month without fail
that's for any to join
that just about what you said
color and unemployment
but the tax decision call that right into doubt
and then everything went away for a couple years
rewrite the conclusion of the republic in more
where it's extremely large
that's minor league baseball decision
that's also something married
which is just outrageous
basically the guy commits
they're saying no right now
it is never disappointing
they would be pretty lit
prices include luxury cars
the long texas families
convert any article in a division
because i never realized it
and love is a choice
basically the size of kansas
they can't read
you get out of college
would that be helpful if you were
food is a very intriguing thing
don't get much room in the attic
in the work force as well
so far he's bitten ten people
a starting point
somebody's going to change it
i've heard an interesting story
i like those a lot
they would tend not to
now i'm covered by my wife's anyway
the grass too far back for eating out
for me it's actually a pretty good topic
that's perfect
when he goes to school
we've always paid taxes
i just thought that they broke up
is university health services open
a pretty fair system compared to other countries
just like the video tell
they're affectionate
a different one
then it goes through the moon
pardon an absolute to expert
teams that they've already beat this year
they been from europe
i love all the windows that they have and want to
i think your choice is summer in there
it only covers the capital side of the equation
you're a red sox fan too
not in a civilized society
i love them like a love boy
so thank you for not using the exploit
the end result of the test were negative
it's a weakness and all
i have a son that just turned sixteen
just for safety
i think the second reason it is fun
the cops are going to come to you
more schools are doing the conversation
comment and join the conversation
you got two choices kid
way to join the food
not without your permission
the neighbor across the street is new
i just love meat
i know that it's good for my health
that would be something
but gotten stuff from similar
it kind of felt like he he didn't care
he was the guy chasing after her
looking at the degree at the end
we do not been under the illusion
so that that was it
the valley and everything
my dogs love the toy
they're into so many different things
if you can reverse the flow of time
she put out the other one
you watch it'll be exactly the same
more men in the crowd do in
the way the law reads
check out our free version
any four hours on the weekend
employee benefits
given the people of detroit don't get
different places of year
the nudity and the curse words
a really violent some like a to know
the team is that decision is up to him
that's disturbing
for sale by the owner
not casting people
but everyone enjoyed the boy
join the initiative
she can't hit it in the air yet
how much more land can they get
to imagine all of his lines in that voice
we've had a lot of fun
she just love this the dog
i haven't the slightest idea
i get hard with the song and dance reading
after he and that merit badge
school taxes and property taxes
it's about time that we did that
president now has a choice
they give us ten minutes
they are probably going to be the person
how are you liking it
so they didn't have to worry about that
dialing services
which i also had done to see before
i'm down here
everybody will say that he is for abortion
that's enough to make anybody paranoid
many types of camping
why don't you do something with those
find something most of you will watch
it's amazing that people actually believe him
they are eighteen to twenty four
it would be back
his voice was looking
i've been days were one person
as usual the level is in the details
twenty five miles per gallon or more
i love that and i really like coach
we're going to take a cooking class there
we do you see that actual
why more it is a good decision to leave
i'm not quite sure why
my wife's about six months along
right now we have their clothes on
how do you feel about that decision
to pick the right person
either that or money
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods
he down to to like once a week
that's what the recycle
do you envision him as a shorter or as a backup
because they built it
but you actually enjoy it
the credit card company
in a way that happened this past season
she was the wife in fatal attraction
that's the most rock stuff
what do you do in lawn and garden
it is my pleasure to meet you
be able to tell old stories
we have a lot of cotton mouth
very good at what they do
at this point i had a bit of a lesson
i pay by check a lot more now
and be a loyal pair of the to itself
this you she said her buy a house paper
for the bad times of the company
right on the straight grain
it's not acceptable
we've gone through this over and over again
i was at one of the big hospitals in new york
it is not know how long the class will last
i have no choice but to get rid of him
as usual the truth is summer in between
have you taking a lot of vacations together
they still look pretty good
it was his decision and you have to respect it
get the recipe from them
you have a decision to make
when did this happen
i hope you enjoy it as much as i did making it
the jury is have to each and every one of us
i didn't think that was right
i help out with that
here is what it all boils down to
that would be all
be an engineer now
he's in a much
don't particularly care for that at all
i live to watch the five o'clock news
see a place called louisiana purchase
i had to let go of the illusion of control
at a for top of a glimpse real to the water
once a week we drive up into the mountains
is absolutely awful
russia goes in there
he's one of the big proponents of that
enjoy the rest of your day
i end up switching stations from time to time
is he a programmer
we are not going to take it any more
this is really hard
i don't know if it would be helpful or not
there was a suspicion
it would still be hard even saturdays
you know in the interests of full cooler
they don't have the hard body
no one was injured in the collision
there is a good chance you're going to get off
usually news and whatever is on public television
i think it's a really good idea
be gentle and all mean
a lot of people i know
the political back up there
would you ever want a dog in the family
i like his movies
it's for a hundred and three four dollars
one is bad enough to
at some point it it will come to an end
then to drop only the legitimate people
that's a nice way of putting it
perspective on an issue and stuff i
what do they call a two and a half
there were no reports of casualties
it didn't break anything
thank you for talking to me i
i've heard about them a
population and so on
they've always been involved
make your voice heard in the comments below
it was when i was a child
then would crime a
before i went back to work
it was just no effort at all
pour that in there too
i have a son that's sixteen
with the car pollution
i would personally be the last resort
we don't have hamsters
in the wrong way
it was a state university
they went all the way down a
my son had a lot of heartburn with that
terrible have a big decision to make
kind of a mauve and gray
then you only go there as a last resort
to the factory goes the soil
boats are advised to avoid the area
been raised on the water i'd never swim in it
there is no what you think and enjoy the show
the line is paid for cash
free will my husband and i
we have a lot of people who work on the line
we were all kids anyway
their money and they do have a
the more room they need to exercise
how many hours do you usually sleep a day
being them and everything like that
is to careful about recycling
we're quite vocal about it
to concentrate on the game
hope you enjoy this list as much as i do
make it all even a
find a change in the wind and go for it
i have a wife and two children i
together there are two sides of the same coin
enjoy and feel way to ask questions
our company does some things a
run out from middle east after the war
are you a done or are you in the work place
so this last year he changed it
if it's a bad decision it's on me
doesn't were in the so
keep you out of trouble that way
my brother lives
you have a separate account for that
well are really they were
they call it a mistrial or something
however there is one k point to keep in mind
kind of the hell
we got hail the size of marbles
we hope you enjoy this place as much as we do
play the hard to the child
it'll be nice to
she has a lot of support
it's a pleasure to meet you of course
some ridiculous stuff like that
well that shouldn't be in there
it turned out to be an excellent decision
they get donations from from the community
helps them understand the world
enjoy it while it last
so i understand that a
they don't all have their own country
to what do i have the pleasure
it got too cold up there
you have to change phones
just a little bit of begging
all the facts played the part
i pay a good deal of taxes
instead of me having to think about it so much
would they be better off under communism
the money part of it is not as rewarding
it's kind of funny to
i was in atlanta a
other savings or investment
i have to read the magazines
i don't know of any other state
long term consequences
it was an older home
just a little over a year ago
did you enjoy the article
the boys were shot in the head police said
couple of pine trees
we've done this is almost five years now
places like ross dress for less
that's what it is here too
research will go on a
he'd been working in a restaurant when they but
you need a white
i left there
enjoy it while you can do
you still have to do
it was back to business as usual
at some point it's going to come up he is
i could really probably get into baseball
to where they came from
unreal by comparison
we don't know how long it will be a time
doing things they like to do to
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want
an environmental engineer
every work has to look at houses
evening shows too
no one person is responsible for everything
i live right quite a bit
thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you
he's got a couple of books out
in this part of the country
i went to england a
it may be other natural things at work
the ones that were made a few years ago
orange county area
the people that worked for those companies
is there a lot of strain
the measure was a long time in the making
how to tell them to
luckily i haven't been all the group
it's happened so many times
if i had to pick a favorite team
it sounds pretty decent
but in the middle
the track is a real pleasure to listen to
in a whole lot of areas
i have to keep up with them
more or less alike
