point blank in the face
just walking the street
he did not want to be in it any more than i did
the teacher had eleven kids
we were promised civil liberties
like here to join senator
lots or insight into politics
don't let them see violence at home
the is is that you familiar is going down to a
what do you write for them

the lot we lived in is now a chance
do you like vehicle do you want a truck
it's all seasonal skin
they pass your phone number on to another company

the middle class to raise them
pretty funny it live there

i'd like to see it be more of an empty part
all of our tin cans
reading more often than usual
capital punishment
everyone knows they're going to get it
my in laws listen to the kind of music i hate
and on your summer a television
and we play out here in the summertime
it never did run right again
you are fairly applied
especially the ones that came out and said the first
we are expected to you know
we later on want
former employees
it looked like they got a women
but you don't know that
i noticed something innocent last time
they won't have to
do you just like home cooking
so it seems to be
the decision to test the article
the old for employment places
it would just depend
i like this saying
they've got the full weight room
you had to have a play
that's neat that you like cross stitch all
the minute i had to come and
my three year old
just not feasible you know
i can't really think of anything else a friend
i'm not sure how to go about it
it's very tedious if don't have a whole group
it was a cordless phone
but it's kind of hard
you can do so much with them
my still get got a minute by the story
it was like four hundred times as much
it's mostly fun
i would feel that i had the right to
you just call him trek
i know the is
it's really hard me
the experience
do you have to wait until all the land fill
really scary to me
i think it is getting worse
we would like to see them to well
i don't live in a house
people put them in
it can swim away fast enough and go hide
for about two hundred dollars
in that time frame
trying to make it through that
anything like that we justified
seven years in the fall
many years or so
i think it does help
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even these buses
take your sick leave
it's been kind of scary
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often
it took four days
the pros and cons of both
we're so bad
you get programming
not that i like rating
i think a cup or two
i don't mean to be knocking
i'd like to see those
a controlled suffering
well closer
i guess he's trained in this
it might be kind of shaky
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
do you have friends with older children
one had more pull to it
i just file federal income tax every year
i grew up on a farm
that was the one that's been really nice to have
they've done it before
the engine was pretty good
how different the people there really are
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so
since buying with one
i make that once in a while
how to do things
i typically am not a cat person
the junk mail that you get
they put him in the nursery office
since this time last year i've changed
they didn't fight together
i seem to know what he was doing
they just live in the company
it had to be given anyway
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance pay for the body damage
one is eight and one is eleven
i was drug tested
you know but and development company
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never painted the outside
that's how we got started
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful
more people want
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it
you have to have a pretty good game
there's small little trucks and cars like that
they don't have the ability to develop it
you got to have a want death country
there's so much going on here
the victims' families and things
being one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
they're gone now
i have never skied before
i don't know what we're going to do
it's second nature
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many
it's like a but gone by
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate
the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
how to see each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was born in texas and i read other years
i guess because i work quite a bit with the
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
training money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i didn't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college away
were his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want top in my lawn
we can keep that out of our minds
from her his photography business
we are doing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time
no one can live on ice
maybe they based it on that mister mom me
it seems like they would be able to
they didn't in the car
she's one of those that loves
now i i have to say it though
mostly with adolescents
i'm not a carpenter or anything like that
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
to our class
basically allowed
do you enjoy camping
it's kind of a show piece
but down there
how do you like your tread mill
it was just too perfect at all times
their self answer is wrong
it is pretty okay
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up
was it six weeks old
fifteen feet wide
to a bigger city
this watched and dip it in the fondue
when you find out who it was
because they been going to school
they will up
have you ever been drug tested
he could get hurt
i'm originally a texan
to you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit
i know a girl
you've got to eat most of the time
to the price of what a be
even in my case
can do whatever they want
because you running it
a little more flexibility
they even look halfway decent
i food prices
i think the decision has been made
they are not sure of themselves
two sides of the same coin
he doesn't really pay attention
if you're ever looking for that
are you on conclusions
that's from the child's standpoint
there is no commercials for a decision
children we save
just get so worn down
you take time you see it
i mean you can earn a lot more money
but at that point i was too far gone
his face was really round out by the crowd
i didn't know it
that was a great little car
over a very long period of time
started investigating
the presence of companies
i wasn't opposed to paying for it
to upholster chairs
they are lovely
we see more and more women being involved
i have to make this one last as long as i can
only to the airport
well tell me this
that would be really awful
question and answer period
because you don't know
for in the red wine and bring to a boil
i'll turn the radio on
they say you're not call in this line
that's the way i feel
what happened to get us to this point
trump has said there was no collision
it was a great feel speaking with you
i had the opposite
we sit around and eat something
i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go
if they didn't have to
that's certainly true
to develop or mention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the box i guess
pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be economically driven also
that be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're so close
during his money
i had never seen anything
this week people started
use to be sick back
i caught a group
i feel so silly
are they all here in the area
i kind of look at it this way
public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
they're oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open air
i think it would do something for it
it has really been nice here
it's the rent dollars
it works out real nice
we've had lots of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just stuff
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm going to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good together as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to sell
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of a case
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
social training to talk about
i am close to reading my single agree
everything to enjoy
he made a real big take himself
their actual rate for them
it was for a murder trial
are you a professional musician
it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program
two sets of grandparents
i call and find out
you want salary too but what
i've heard about him
we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for sure
they were okay
to find a button
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i find it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you got the buy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i live out in the country
i'm originally from me
to grow up and to do what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can guess i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the armed forces did so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very open
we're sort the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents a
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not counting on it
i like to have somebody come with me
was always kind of tough
not sure that's something i want to do
most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just that it's been any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
he has did a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm guessing from that
um or or or think in about four hours
it's going to happen
i only way chicken away
horrible stuff like that
an upper or the symphony or something
if they don't have any different relatives
i watched the news on car
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to compare it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was faster than a
i want them to come back up next year
does that when i was a kid
things that uh under state a section
i was an animal
i don't have a lot of time to do it
and i'm up here
i enjoy them coming
but it is a pretty low crime rate
big closet space
you're welcome to go some place else
i would offer a
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different a
we'd have to build less prisons to
is light reading a
well we just started a
we started taking her a
my mother and i were a
we are so busy a
i'd like to go bird hunting a
sometimes you have to ask them for that
then do it all over again a
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad checks a
do you watch star trek a
so you don't have to put it down to
i don't see much t v mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and see
i don't get too many of those a
did they do that be he went in or what
i'm getting rid of this car a
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period
of course it's real convenient to
my husband and i both went to
you learn me about the taxes and stuff
just a little shell to go on a suit
then we put a reap in there
where is it going to be a
fifty nine kilometers for killing a
they need it early a
it shouldn't be decide a
sample services to come to
which i thought was a real enticing question
well that's about it really a
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish a
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country a
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's just not enough for a total
one thing led to another
you haven't point of the country
i don't have any job benefits to speak of
it really helps those people
but a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for years in a motor home
if you've only got a token both there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot really people did
they think it's kind of cool
some is too much
i don't know how my father did it
lived on a farm for six years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
ceiling and gas
the commercial strict
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
savings and loan
they plastered over drywall
a class white grapes
the some element
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how she got it
you're a person women
getting back seat for the state
if you have any doubt whatsoever
literary movie
