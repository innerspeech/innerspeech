for me it was a
it looks like they've got a weapon
but you don't know that
i noticed something innocent last time

so it seems to be a
the decision to set the article a
they're all for employment places
it would just depend
i like seeing a

you had to have a pool
that's neat that you like cross stitch and all
the minute i had to come in a
my three year old a
just not people you know
i can't really think of anything else offend
i'm not sure how to go about it
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group
it was a cordless phone
but it's kind of hard
you can do so much with them
my still get got a minute by the story
it was like four hundred times as much
it's probably one
i would feel that i had the right to
you just call him tracks a
i know the is
it really hurts me
the experience
do you have to wait until all the land fill
really scary to me
i think it is getting worse
i really would like to see them to well

for about two hundred dollars
in that time frame
trying to make it through that

seven years in the pros
twenty years or so
i think it does help
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even this boss
take your sick leave
it's been kind of scary
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often
it took four days
the pros and cons of both
we're so bad a
you get programming
not that i like waiting
i think a cup or two
i don't mean to be knocking
i'd like to see those
a controlled something
real close
i guess he's trained in this uh
it might be kind of shaky
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
do you have friends with older children
one had more pull to it
i just file federal income tax every year
i grew up on a farm
that was the one that's been really nice to have
they've done it before
the end was pretty good
how different the people there really are
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so
since mine was fun
i make that once in a while
how to do things
i typically am not a cat person
the junk mail that you get
they put him in the nurse's office
since this time last year i've changed
they didn't fight together
i seem to know what he was doing
they just live in the community
it had to be given anyway
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance pay for the body damage
one is eight and one is eleven
i was drug tested
your neighbors and drilling company
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never painted the outside
that's how we got started
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful
more people want
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it
you have to have a pretty good team
they're small little trucks and cars like that
they don't have the ability to develop it
you got to have a one tenth indicator
there's so much going on here
the extreme family and things
being one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
they're gone now
i have never skied before
i don't know what we're going to do
it's second nature
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many
it's like a but grown by
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate
the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
how to chase each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was born in texas and i read other areas
i guess because i work quite a bit with our
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i don't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college always
were his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want to be in my line
we can keep that out of our minds
from for his country business
we are doing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time

maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
it seems like they would be able to
just didn't find the car
she's one of those that loves

mostly with adolescents
i'm not a carpenter or anything like that
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
two hour classes
basically a lot
do you enjoy camping
it's kind of a show piece
payment down there
how do you like your tread mill
it was just too perfect at all times
their self and is wrong
it is pretty okay
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up
was it six weeks old
lifting it would do
to a big city
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
when you find out who it was
because they been going to school
they will up
have you ever been drug tested
he could get hurt
i'm originally a texan
so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit
i know a girl
we've got to get most of the time
to the place of what a be
even in my case
can do whatever they want
because you own it
a little more flexibility
they even like if we didn't do
i would price
i think the decision has been made
they are not sure of themselves
two sides of the same line
he doesn't really pay attention to
if you're ever looking for that
so you own conclusions do
that's from the child's standpoint
there is no compile for a decision
golden retriever
just get so worn down
they're stuck time you say it
i mean you can earn a lot more money
but at that point i was too far gone
his face was really ground out by the ground
i didn't know it
that was a great little car
over a very long period of time a
ford investigating
the presence of companies
i wasn't opposed to paying for it
to upholster chairs
they are lovely
we see more and more women being involved
i have to make this one last as long as i can
on to the airport
well tell me this
that would be really awful
question and answer period
because you don't know
for in the red wine and bring to a boil
all to the radio on a
they say if you're not call in this line
that's the way i feel
what happened to get us to this point
trump is said there was no collision
it was a great pleasure speaking with you
i had the opposite
we sit around and eat popcorn
i don't have busy
that would have been best time to go to
if that doesn't have to
that's certainly true
you tell me your attention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to see half my risk
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the box i guess
pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be economically driven also
that be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're so close
on his money
i had never seen anything
this week people started
used to be six bucks
i caught a group
i feel so silly
are they all here in the area
i kind of look at it this way
public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
through oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open air a
i think it would do something for it to
it has really been nice here
it's the rent dollars
it worked out real nice
we've had lots of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i live right in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just tough
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm beginning to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with different
that's true i didn't think about that
good deal as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to fall
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying a a fish
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
usually waiting to talk about
i am close to reading my english degree

the actual rate for them
it was for a murder trial

i've heard about him
we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for cheese
they were okay
to find a band
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up three times
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he really makes it
where you got the boy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i lived out in the country
i'm originally from me
to grow up and to do what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the armed forces did so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very open
where are the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents a
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not counting on it

most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just get it in any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day though
girl and a boy
he has used a lot
it's a little bit financial type things i
an economic incentive for people to vote
i guess from that
same here uh sure thing in about four hours
what's going to happen
i only way chicken way
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something uh
if they don't have any living relatives i
i watched the news on it for a
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties

i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was pressure then
i want them to come back up next year

things that are under state recession
i was an administer

light reading
well we just started a
we started taking her
my mother and i were
we are so busy
i'd like to go bird hunting
sometimes you have to ask them for that a day
then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends and
about a thousand bad checks

i don't get too many of those
did they do that be we went in or what do i
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period do

where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers per gallon a day

that's just not enough for a total
one thing led to another
two different parts of the country
i didn't have any job benefits to speak of
it really helps those people
but a cramp in your viewing do
it's a pretty good size church
camping for you in a motor home
