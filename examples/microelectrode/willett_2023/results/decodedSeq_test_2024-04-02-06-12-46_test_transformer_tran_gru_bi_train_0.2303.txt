and it's not a judge but a case of the place who made the decision in
we seem to be running the population suppose right in our own backyard
combined separate mirrors and all you in a lot more for the very end
the engine will be straight void of if you think um a couple for
we we get grass out and spend less energy making cooling decision in
let me ask you did you do
to some ticket prices are cheap by exposed to go environment
an adult mail because they are not able for eating selfish
in the long it would do well for us to put in mind the vision of peace
you really look at you a
we look for solid ideas and anger on the floor
if it really is field to mess up to enjoy we estimate
well put it up with a lemon life for dinner

the car to have a gift to it as you would when it is right
any dollars usually little with it by cutting really inspection and trim
the car is barking up the wood instead of
the kid version is given low
they seem got rid of it
a shop plumber was told by a work all day
by you and killing nobody but yourself

that was no longer feel any
in country hell we will happen

what the saying oh
even know and they that the fire
where is you usually upbeat personality
i can be to meet a line in place to face
with a filling up it could get into day
much in shape example
it's really hard to find something that works
and i love the saying
i do have a friend that when
just be in the back
actually it makes sense to a certain extent
to the government that he was employed
they feel good about what they're doing
besides it's an invasion of personal privacy
so you travel a lot
they were going to wait
and kind of a good environment to live in
the best of enjoyed
i don't know what you think about the point
i believe it costs about ten dollars
what in the world drugs are you on to
enjoyed every box
a couple of times
i had the brakes done on it
what i do as a fifth and have been real handy
i know when i was working
it's a package deal
i have seen it
the measure already passed a sudden committee
they told me that this was a topic
in the red square or wherever said
they did a lot of floor work and stuff
you can gain too much weight
recent legislation
i'm a car buff too
you're paying from a grateful heart
an over real leave a while to smoke
noise causes air pollution
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that
just saying that care vision is a necessity
factors that effect cording of an employee
if you drink a lot of can will say work
that's a nice car
vision leaders
the only other place i've ever vacation
i just kind of went through
this is nothing first we need
do you have your big
so you know it keeps us pretty busy
that's a science in itself
so when you get in tight situations
i can relate to that
it's all ready quit playing
if they're around anymore
i am not even aware that i could have seen it
the rest of asian guys are feeling too
and on occasion
most points at the end ones
i think it's one hundred and eighty miles
we don't usually take the kids when we go there
one of those generation novels
he'll never get caught
i don't buy the newspaper
bring something for a potluck picnic
i'll take it out
improved vision does not work
else where reported
you just like to sit down and watch it
he helps by giving little point
they all grew up in new york city
you make such a choice
but they have snakes over there
a good positive direction
that's what i was going to point out
i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon
it's a telecommunications type of company
i work out of my home
the way it works
it doesn't have an air conditioner
then you have to make a salad
having the bible in the equation
i read in the paper
i'm in the speech processing business
once every year or so
you don't eat it at all
all men tried and true
i think that's something we might want
he thought for a few minutes
that is a sad situation
they do have capital punishment
it was nice talking to you sally
my favorite team is the rangers
kind of goes along with what you were saying
why they don't go with first one
we just would
they are the detroit dallas
he went to vietnam one man and came back another
as any city grows up
so you did buy a pattern
it's about six and a half percent
i agree with the phone
so i think it's going to be a lot easier
not too much soy sauce
we take a certain portion of your paycheck
plus you
and i don't know what's going to happen
i think we have about thirteen months left on it
i do particularly find it annoying
they have clubs and a swimming pool
part of you
it really is worth while to sew
i thought that was a little incentive
public transportation
focal point
and on and on despite
what are we doing
my job tends to be very demanding
you know it was just in case
and most people like that are old
that's what i was doing before
the best teachers and the best students
i don't like it cold
she was inaugurated in january
wait a minute
those are no good anymore
i do want to have a raised bed
i see that but yet i know too
it wasn't organized enough for me
if i don't know the story line
it's of like in the place
we came by leisure
he had choices to make a counselor told him
the last time he came was in march
i'm getting pretty
it's really a cost
have little more luxury but want a lot more
you guys really are newlyweds
we've got a ton from my son
competition with japan
it still makes most of his profit in asia
i think that is important too
have a good evening
normally we tend to make these occasion
he didn't eat flies
most of the time they don't bother with it
they didn't give it to get it back
i'm sure all the lakes are in it
the family is that to discuss
a lot of the areas moving southward
when course it's a
contact points
this morning it was twenty nine
getting real with his first
they fell out because of the drug issue
they are done with a flour tortilla
not stuck in a minute
that is usually for some people
i'm really from my other son did those hours
where do you have to do a whole bunch of work
i take it she was an account
go to a tip for the nation
no problem there at all
their way of life can't
let me that white bank account happen

i always think my daughters with come out
no curry is still allowed to receive all

what you need is a tougher punishment regime
so it was really too late to do much
i want to go the that golf course down the
you get a little taste of it and you say no
they don't even take my story relating summer
chicago and philadelphia
i don't know if you have ever heard of it
social but uh
that's like the way he feels
do you really not remember joy
it have been doing that kind of it
the ranks of asian writers are willing to
the money will are the current conclusions
people will happen in the morning
i can to your whole self do
that's the other bar that we went to that night
i don't know why do
you can take take love explosion presents her
he's in first grade now
i guess to some company that not going fast enough
intricately mostly and is
something a little extra joy
i kind of wish that they had a little kid for the boys
killer bee instinct toy
i had heard about that toy
the ability of people to access a toy
that's probably one of the reasons joy
quite a few movies are based off of that toy
but when i went home that's all i could think about
i'm all of that actually
a couple was on here under
it was something easy i could do
i think was a lot of people for to pass really
brown and black patches of her
the jury is expected to end it's decision
imports
i don't get to watch
well all money now
apparently that more
and everything
they probably do it to their benefit
that is good that they're like that
there is some different work in her report
many of times in calling been by on work
the you work take some place the me
when we were in high school it was always fun
she knows how to do that
are you going to go see the elixir of love
i'm sure there are some
that's kind of like what we'd like to do
quite a lot of very
i haven't been to a baseball game in years
but it's pretty anymore
list of all and business
it just kind of going on forever
that's the only way you can get to canada from here
he's got a really low
he of the last act from the life
i have to think about it some more now
i was really kind of excited to start reading
what are you saying
for instance
i enjoyed it very much
he had a gun and her mother money
and all version of this article
you might even be able to get a job there
enjoyable to use
we came to a fork in the wood at night
he really likes it and i don't do
it's just an all day
i think there is confusion and
so someplace for the day is
but there can to learn it sometimes is
it was the big one is
it's kind of a depressing topic
every six months i have to pay my taxes
i've never been sailing is
i have six of college is
and then the next one down is in the red
enjoy the adventure is
not like though is
too many serious problems for the longer term is
are there any other countries or send your engine in applying
i consider myself what they call a full timer
for family it is
do you know that i've never seen a monkey is
i know both people is
i recommend the answer to a lot of people is
you have a computer for yourself at home and
it's the original is
you can't blame them is
more just more candles is
i guess traffic could be an annoyance is
we've gone for meaning food and lebanese food is
i hate to just and king is
football is an exciting sport is
i'm glad it's on a day
i don't know the details is
when you take more about the history of treasury a inflation
too many horror stories out there and
every major city has a letter day
go to the two and two elephant and drugs and things like that
it is kind of one day
that appeared to be eight or nine years old
i'm kind of out of it right now and
i know right and everything in the people do
i just can't do it is
not everybody shows up is
being have with them out of the little time is
was just based on the fact toy
wasn't it your state that had police involved is
do you like you take it all toy
i don't have too much there is
i can hit it in a day joy
we will spread joy
the time box is
the case where you parent is
i'm wearing shorts is
you have some playing time is
where do you get the cook book is
but in the have of evil joy
without the feel it's money is
all that next week joy
we do as a matter of fact enjoy
i have some games as a
we're going to feel it what it is
the news is a good way to keep up to date is
point blank in the face joy
that walking the street is
he did not want to be in it any more than i did
the teacher had eleven kids is
we were most civil liberties is
like how to join family is
what are in into politics is
don't that them see falling at home is
the issue is that you more is going on
what do you write for them is
our point of view is
the lot we lived in is now a chance
do you like people do you want a talk
it's all traditional looking is
they pass your phone number on to another company
they had six four of them is
well i like the seventies is
this is vision as corporation is
it's probably going to be a real old used one
enjoy your day is
the mental half to raise them is
body different at five thirty
i'll make us a mirror last year
i mean a large flat plate
i'd like to see it be more of an an more part
all of our tin cans
paying more often than usual
capital punishment is
everyone knows they're going to get it
my inlaws listen to the kind of music i hate
and on your computer or television
and we play out here in the summertime
it never did run right again
you are really excited
especially the ones that came out and said the place
we can cut you you know
we're really one point
probably because
it looks like they've got a weapon
but you don't know that
i noticed something it last time
they wouldn't have to
do you all like home cooking
so it seems to be
the decision to discuss the article
well all for employment cases
it would just depend
i like ice skating
they've got the full weight room
you had to have a plate
that's neat that you like cross stitch and all
the minute i had to come in
my three year old
just not people you know
i can't really think of anything else offhand
i'm not sure how to go about it
it's very tedious if you have a whole group
it was a really fun
but it's kind of hard
you can do so much with them
my school just got a mission by the lord
it was like four hundred times that much
it's maryland
i would feel that i had the right to
you just call him track
i know there is
it really hurts me
the experience
we have to wait until all the land fill
really scary to me
i think it is getting worse
we would like to see them to well
i don't live in a house
people put them in
it can from where fast enough and go hide
for about two hundred dollars
in that time frame
trying to make it for that
anything like that we specified
seven years in the pros
many years or so
i think it does help
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even this boss
that you pick up
it's been kind of scary
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often
it took four days
the pros and cons of both
we're around
you get homecoming
not that i like reading
i think a cup or two
i don't mean to be knocking
i'd like to see those
controlled substance
i'll close
i guess he's trained in this
it might be kind of scary
perhaps not in the manner that we do it
do you have friends with older children
one and more pro to it is
i just file federal in time tax every year
i grew up on a farm is
that was the one that's been really nice to have
i've done it before is
the end was pretty good is
how different the people there really are
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so is
since mine was born is
i think that once in a while is
how to do things is
i typically am not a cat person
the junk mail that you get is
they put him in the nurse's office
since this time last year i've changed
they didn't put together is
he seems to know what he was doing is
they just live in the company is
it had to be november anyway
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance pay for the body damage
one is eight and one is eleven
i was drug tested is
so nice and developing community
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never found the it is
that's how we got card is
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful is
more people want is
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't expense it is
you have to have a pretty good team
the small little trucks and cars like that
they don't have the ability to sell it
you got to have a one tenth indicator
there's so much going on here is
the victims' families and things
being one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left
they're gone now
i have never skied before
i don't know what we're going to do
it's second nature
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many
it's like a bulge in my
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
it's really unfortunate
the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
you to chase each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage is
it really doesn't make any difference
i was one in texas and i read other areas
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a people color
that's the freedom of choice
i don't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it is
one in college always
were his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want to be in my lawn
we can keep that out of our minds
from for his country is
we are seeing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time
no one can live on ice
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
it seems like they would be able to
just don't find the car
she's one of those that loves
so i just have to feel it though
mostly with adolescents
i'm not a carpenter or anything like that
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
to our class
basically adult is
do you enjoy camping
it's kind of a show piece
moment and there
how do you like your tread mill
it was just too perfect at all times
their self and is wrong
it is pretty okay
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up
was it six weeks old
if in bed and
or a bigger city is
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue
when you find out who it was
because they been going to school
they will up
have you ever been drug tested
he could get hurt
i'm usually a texan is
do you got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit
i know a girl
we've got to it most of the time
to the price of what a buy
even in my case
can do whatever they want
because you own it is
a lot more flexible is
they haven't looked halfway decent is
i could see is
i think the decision has been made us
they are not sure of themselves so
you kind of the same can see
he doesn't really pay attention is
if you're ever looking for that size
are you on conclusion us
that's from the child's standpoint
there is no sample for a decision
golden retriever is
just get to one and see
the take time you say it us
i mean you can earn a lot more money
but at that point i was too far gone
price was really found out by the crowd
i didn't notice it is
that was a great little car us
over a very long period of time it's
old and asking us
most parents of companies see
i wasn't able to plan for it is
to upholster chairs is
they are lovely is
we see more and more women being involved
i have to make this one last as long as i can
only to the airport is
well tell me this is
that would be really awful is
question and answer period is
because you don't know is
for in the red wine and back to a boil
i'll turn the radio on us
they say if you not call in this line is
that's the way i feel is
what happened to get us to this point is
pop has said there was no collision is
it was a great feel playing with you see
i heard the part
we sit around and eat something
i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go
if they didn't have to
that's only for is
just tell me your attention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had too many people
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was worth the buck i guess
pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be economically driven also
that would be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're so close
when his money is
i had never seen anything
this week people started
used to be six bucks
i caught a cop
i feel so silly
are they all here in the area
i kind of look at it this way
public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
for oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
it would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open air
i think it would do something for it
it has really been nice here
it's the rent dollars
it worked out real nice
i've had lots of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just tough
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm beginning to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good deal as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's not going to fall
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying a fish
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
usually going to talk about
i am close to visit my uncle year
everything's still inches
he been a real big take himself
that's actually good for them
it was for a murder trial
are you a professional musician
it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program
two sets of grandparents
i call and find out
you want salary too but what
i've heard about him
we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would would for choice
they were like us
to find a man is
on a working farm is
after we had them for several years just
if they work at it a little bit is
we don't have enough is
what are you making us
absolutely nothing is
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
it's about any kind of music is
we like mexican food is
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times is
you've got to find an even line us
i think he really makes it is
where you got the buy us
it all starts to become similar is
i could go along with that is
it's like one second of recording is
that's a big thing with me us
i'm the only one us
i've been calling you on that us
if there starts to be a lot of violence a
walking seems to be the best us
i don't think too many of them are anymore us
how do you feel about your game us
when i lived out in the country is
i'm originally from maine us
to go up and to get what they want to do this
we just keep track of it on paper is
i had friends just
i've work in whole us
they can pretty much get everybody there is
you can just say i'm sorry us
the engine blew up in it just
the armed forces did so much us
i don't have a lot of time is
i know they will just
sometimes they're not very open us
we are the problem is
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area is
i'm not quite done on it is
i like to have somebody come with me
was all kind of stuff is
not sure that's something i want to do is
most of the stores will accept those days
that is pretty unusual is
that's what he grew up listening to is
she'll be two in july is
i just but it's been any money is
the news or something is
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy is
he has did a lot is
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm really from that is
um you do your thing in about four hours
it's going to happen is
i only way in there is
horrible stuff like that is
an opera or the symphony or something
if you don't have any living relatives
i watch the news on where is
i figured of the top songs of the eighties
i don't have much to compare it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was pressure then is
i want them to come back next year
does that when i was a kid
things that are under state inspection
i was in america
i don't have a lot of time to do it
when i'm up here is
i enjoy them coming is
but it has a pretty low crime rate is
big closet space is
they're welcome to go some place else
what are
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different
we'd have to build less prisons
is light reading
well we just started
we started taking her
my mother and i were
we are so busy
i'd like to go bird hunting
sometimes you have to ask them for that
then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad checks
do you watch star trek
so you don't have to put it down
i don't see much t v mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and say
i don't get too many of those
they do that where he went in or what
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period
of course it's real convenient
my husband and i both went
you learn more about the pictures and stuff
just a little shell to go on a to
then we put our receipts in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers for calling
they did it all
it shouldn't be destroyed
some people have to come
which i thought was a real ending occasion
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think the more
that's really not enough for a total
one thing like to another
what part of the country
i didn't have any job benefits to speak of
it really helps those people
but a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for you in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot really people did
they think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i don't know how my father did it
lived on a farm for six years
i think it's something as a trial
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
curling and guess
the simple tactics
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
savings and loan
they plastered over terrible
all less what keep
the problem element
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how you get it
you're a person my son
getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts
if you have any doubts whatsoever
let me
i can't remember here
