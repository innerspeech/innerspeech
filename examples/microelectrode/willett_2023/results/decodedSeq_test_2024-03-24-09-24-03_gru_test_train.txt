how to see each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference

that's the freedom of choice
i didn't know too much about it

because you own it
a little more possibility
they even look after way distant
i food pricey
i think the decision has been made
they are not sure of themselves
two sides of the same coin

golden retriever

over a very long period of time
going investigating
my presence of companies

i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go
if they didn't have to
that's certainly true
you developed for a mention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the back i guess
a pop up trailer
you're with the home office now
they seem to be economically driven also
that would be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even know they're too close
doing his money
i had never seen anything
these rich people started
use to be six bucks
i caught a group

i kind of look at it this way
public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
they're oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open here
i think it would do something for it
it has really been nice here
since i went colleges
it works out real nice
we've had lot of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it

i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just tough
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm beginning to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good together as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to fall
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of our face
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
usual getting to talk about
i mean close to receiving my english degree

we've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for cheese
they were okay
to find a man and
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i find it a lot of time
they've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you got the boy
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i live out in the country
i'm originally from maine
to grow up and to decide what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've worked in hotels
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine will up in it
the some cases it so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very home
we're toward the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not gardening on it

most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just get it been any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day so
a girl and a boy
he has used a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm getting from that
time for a you're thing in about four how
what's going to happen
i only way sixteen away
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any differing relatives
i watched the news on it
a factor of the type kind of the city
i do not have much to compare it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was faster than
i want them to come back up next year
does that when i was a kid
things that are under state direction
i was an intimate
i don't have a lot of time to do it
when i'm up here
i enjoy them coming
but it has a pretty low crime rate
big closet space
you're welcome to go some place else
i would offer

i've heard different
we'd have to build less prisons
is light reading
well we just started
we started taking her
my mother's and i were

then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad takes

i don't get too many of those
did they do that be he went in or right
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period
of course it's real convenient

just a little shell to go on a suit
then we put a rip in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers for killing
than need it early
it shouldn't be destroyed
chemical services to come
which i thought was a real entering question
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think so anymore
that's just not enough for a total
one thing led to another
you haven't point of the country
i didn't have any job benefits to speak of
it really at those people
but a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size search
camping for years in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot really people did
they think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i didn't know how my father did it
lived on a farm for six years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
pollen and gas
the commercial districts
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
savings and loan
they plastered over all
all lace white grapes
the time development
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how she got it
your vision reimbursement
getting back seat for the prostate
if you have any doubt whatsoever
literary movies
i can't remember where
