the only other place i've ever vacation is
i just kind of went through a
this is amazing first we need it
do you have your bag it
so you know it keeps us pretty busy
that's a science in itself

you just like to sit down and watch it
he helps by giving little point it
but they all grew up in new york city
you make such a choice did
but they have snakes over there
a good positive direction it
that's what i was going to point out it
i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon
it's a allocation type of company it
i work out of my home is
the way it works right
it doesn't have an air conditioner
then you have to make a salad it
leaving the vegetables in the equation it
i read in the paper it
i'm in the speech processing business

you don't eat it at all but
i've been tried and true
i think that's something we might want it
she thought for a few minutes it
that is a sad situation is
they do have capital punishment in
it was nice talking to you dudley did
my favorite team is the rangers just
kind of goes along with what you were saying did

i agree with the phone is
so i think it's going to be a lot easier
not too much soy sauce is
we take a certain portion of your basic is
who sponsors you did
and i don't know what's going to happen it
i think we have about thirteen months left on it
i do particularly find it annoying it
they have clubs and a swimming pool does
our point of view is
it really is worth while to sew it
i felt that was a little incentive to
public transportation is
vocal point is
i run on and on despite the
what are we doing this
my job tends to be very demanding it's
you know it was just in case it
and most people like that are old and
that's what i was doing before it
the best teachers and the best students did
i don't like it cold but
she was inaugurated in january of
wait a minute did
those are no good anymore did
i do want to have a raised bed i
i see that but yet i know to be
it wasn't organized enough for me it
if i don't know the story line it
that i've liked in the past is
your time my leisure is

competition with japan is
it still makes most of it's profit in asia
i think that is important to us
have a good evening it
honestly we tend to make these occasion
he didn't eat flies it
most of the time they don't bother with it is
they didn't keep it so i got it back it
i'm sure all the kids are in it is
the family issues that get discussed in
a lot of the industry's moving southward it
when disco isn't enough it
contact points in
this morning it was cut down in
didn't realize with his birth in
the fall out because of the drug issue is
this are done with a flour tortilla just
don't take an imagine it
that is usually for some people it
i'm away from my other son during those hours it
well do you have to do a whole bunch of work
i take it she was an account in
go to a trip for the nation it
no problem there at all it
their way of life stands in
let me that one bank account came in
filters for air filtration for hospitals in
i do that when we travel it
he only saw the end of the first quarter but
is there work to support this conclusion just
buy a sewing machine it
as soon as we get this house finished it
and just keep skipping always at the us a
all the money is
my husband has a two kids out back just
we'd kind of seen it
i always thought my daughters with come out just
no country is still allowed to receive oil
let's see about getting parents more involved just
just me that went back and didn't it
what you need is a tougher punishment regime the
so it was really too late to do much did
i want to go to that golf course down south
you get a little taste of it and you say no
they don't even check my story cutting summer it
chicago and philadelphia it
i don't know if you have ever heard of it it
social but it
that's exactly the way he feels just
do you really not remember it
it's i'm enjoying that kind of it is
the ranks of asian writers are willing to it
the emission will door this correspond conclusion a
people really happened during the morning it
we can do your whole self it
that's the other bar that we went to that night just
i don't know why did
you can pick steak love explosion benefits are just
he's in first grade now a
i guess to some companies that aren't going fast enough it
instantly dramatically and it
something a little extra a
i kind of wish that they had a little lake for the boys
killer bee instinct is
i hadn't heard about that is
the ability of people to access health care is
that's probably one of the reasons it
quite a few movies are based off of that it
but when i went home that's all i could think about it
i'm north of that actually in
a couple working on here and did
it was something easy i could do
i think why a lot of people go to west virginia
brown and black part of her did
the jury it's expect to and it's decision it
some point in
i don't get to watch it
well all money now it is
help me that more it
but everything is
they're probably doing it to their parents
that is good that they like that
there is some different talk in her report it
maybe six times in killing bed by on work
the new york take some place the way it
when i was in high school it was always fun
she knows how to do that
are you going to go see the elixir of love
i'm sure there are times in
that's kind of like what we'd like to do
quite a lot of variety in
i haven't been to a baseball game in years
men can't paint any more it
a friend of ours and been in
it just kind of dragged on forever it
that's the only way you can get to canada from here
he got a very low it
here of the test from the left it
i have to think about it some more now in
i was really kind of excited to start reading it
what are you saying did
for instance did
i enjoyed it very much it
he had occasion on her mother money in
an early version of this article it
you might even be able to get a job there in
enjoyable to use it
we came to uh work in the world out and do
he really like it and i don't know
it's nice in small
i think there is confusion in
just go someplace for the day it
but they're going to learn it sometimes too
it was the big one in
it's kind of a depressing topic i
every six months i have to pay my taxes
i've never been sailing in
i have six years of college a
and then the next one down is in the married
enjoy the adventure it
not really though is
too many serious problems for the long term it
are there any other countries or sounds for it in exploiting a
this i can tell myself what they call a full timer go
for family read it
do you know that i've never seen a monkey
i know both people did
he's recommend the hunter to a lot of people it
do you have a computer for yourself at home
it's the original it
you can buy them a
more choice for counselors is
i guess traffic could be an annoyance i
we've gone for romanian food and lebanese food
i had to just and killing it
football is an exciting sport it
i'm glad it's on
i don't know the details of
when you make more about the system of treasury us inflation
so many horror stories out there
every major city has a theater
go to the zoo and see elephant and dogs and things like that
it be kind of fun it
that's supposed to be eight or nine years old
i'm kind of out of it right now
i don't what would have been in the paper in
my brother can do it in
not everybody shows up a
been have with them out of the name of fun the
it was just based on the fact a
wasn't it your state that had police involved in
did you actually you take out all the
i don't have too much either a
i can put it in a day a
very well said the
well jam box the
the tree was to protect the
i'm wearing shorts the
you have some fishing time i
where did you get this took back a
but in the case of evil a
but the people it's minor a
all we that next week a
we do as a matter of fact the
i have some games
we're going to feel it worked out a
the news is a good way to keep up to date a
point blank in the face a
just walking the street a
he did not want to be in it any more than i did i
the teacher had eleven kids
we were most civil liberties a
like here to join in a
that are in in politics a
don't let them see violence at home the
the is is that you simply is going under the
what do you write for them to
our point of view
that that we lived in is now a in a
for your next vehicle do you want a like a
it's all traditional looking a
they pass your phone number on to another company is
they had sixty four of them i
well i like the seventies a
this is vision as elevation is
it's probably going to be a real old news on a
enjoy your day the
the middle east to raise them in
friday afternoon at five thirty it
make cost a measure last year it
i mean a large flat plate is
i'd like to see it be more of an indoor sports
all of our tin cans in
paying more often than usual but
capital punishment is
everyone knows they're going to get it done
my inlaws listen to the kind of music i hate
and on your computer or television it
and we pay out here in the summertime it
it never did run right again did
you are really excited it
especially the ones that came out and said the place
be an excuse to you know it
we at one point just
because it
it looks like they've got a weapon in
but you don't know that it
i noticed something interesting last time it
they won't have to do
do you just like home cooking it
so it seems to be a
the decision to get the article in
well for employment cases it
it would just depend
i like just sitting in
they've got the full weight room in
you had to have a pool in
that's neat that you like classical all the
the money i had to common it
my three year old is
just not feasible you know it
i can't really think of anything else a friend in
i'm not sure how to go about it but
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group
it was a cordless phone in
but it's kind of hard it
you can do so much with them so
i still get got hit by the started it
it was like four hundred times that much the
it's mostly done in
i would feel that i had the right to a
you just kill him protect it
i know there is
it's really hard make a
the experience did
you have to wait until all the land sell the
they said to me it
i think it is getting worse but
we would like to see them do well but
i don't live in a house in
people put them in
it can swim away fast enough and go hide a
for about two hundred dollars a
in that time frame it
trying to make it through that did
anything like that we decided
seven years in the pros did
many years or so ago
i think it does help it
that has got to be blooming this time of year
even these buses the
take your sick leave it
it's been kind of scary a
the leaves are just dead
we try to go so often it
it took four days it
the pros and cons of both is
we're so bad
you get payment
not that i like reading it
i think a cop or two did
i don't mean to be knocking it
i'd like to see those it
a controlled happening is
real close it
i guess he's trained in this is
it might be kind of tricky it
perhaps not in the manner that we do it in
do you have friends with older children to
one had more pull to it
i just file federal income tax every year
i grew up on a farm and i
that was the one that's been really nice to have
they've done it before so i
the engine was pretty good so i
how different the people there really are to
we get out on the water occasionally
maybe once every call or so i do
that's been was been a a
i make that once in a while to do
how to do things to do
i typically am not a cat person i
the junk mail that you get a day
they put him in the nurse's office so
since this time last year i've changed a
they didn't put together a do
i seem to know what he was doing a
they just live in the company a
it had to be november anyway i
if you do decide to go with child care
the insurance pay for the body damage i
one is eight and one is eleven i
i was drug tested so i
you neighbors and developing companies
they are going to get a gun no matter what
when i was in high school we had a choice
never painted the outside of a
that's how we got started to do
a nicer desk than i could afford
it's really beautiful to see
more people want to do
i think what they will do is start paying mexico
i haven't experienced it so i
you have to have a pretty good frame i
they're small little trucks and cars like that i
they don't have the ability to develop it i
you got to have a one tenth indicator so
there's so much going on here so i
the become family and things just
being one of these late in life mothers a
the drug dealers a
my wife's mother is the only grandparent left a
they're gone now the
i have never skied before just
i don't know what we're going to do it
it's second nature to
find out where the languages are
we don't get to see too many a
it's like a budget gun buy it
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars to a
it's really unfortunate a
the next morning you want to take them out so
if the news we're getting is any good it
if something goes wrong a
i haven't seen any a
how to chase each other all through the house uh uh
you don't worry about them too much do
that kind of gas mileage though
it really doesn't make any difference in a
i was born in texas and i read other areas a
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers
i guess i haven't had that much experience in
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them a
does it have to be a special color a
that's the freedom of choice just
i don't know too much about it just
my son plays football but
see how the family liked it in a
one in college was a
were his civil rights violated just a
it looks like it would be a
doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want stop in my lawn just
we can keep that out of our minds a
from for his country business to
we are doing that here as well so
that's what made me hope it
it depends on the person it is
i don't make that much to do
it's been a long time to do
no one can live on us to do
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie
it seems like they would be able to do
they didn't find the car a
she's one of those that loves to do
so uh i have to say it though uh uh
mostly with adolescents it is
i'm not a carpenter or anything like that
i like to listen to piano music a whole lot
to our class a
basically a lot just a
do you enjoy camping in a
it's kind of a show piece to see
right down there is a
how do you like your tread mill to do
it was just too perfect at all times to
their self and is wrong to do
it is pretty okay to do
i thought that that was what celery seed was for
i couldn't get her up to a
was it six weeks old a
fifteen feet would do
to a bigger city to do
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue a
when you found out who it was a a
because they been going to school to do
they will up to a
have you ever been drug tested a a
he could get hurt too
i'm originally a texan so i
so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
really doing it quite a bit to do
i know a girl is a
you've got to get most of the time it
to the price of what a buy a a
even in my case it's a
can do whatever they want to do
because you own it it
a little more costly it
they even look halfway decent did
a food processor is
i think the decision has been made it
they are not sure of themselves just
two kinds of the same kind of
he doesn't really pay attention just
if you're ever looking for that does
are you on conclusions just
that's from the child's standpoint it
there is no commercials for a decision just
children of the
just get so worn down it
the same time you say it is
i mean you can earn a lot more money a
but at that point i was too far gone just
his face was really ground out by the kid a
i didn't know it did
that was a great little car it
over a very long period of time it
started investigating it
the presence of companies is
i wasn't opposed to paying for it just
to upholster chairs just
there are probably a
we see more and more women being involved in
i have to make this one last as long as i can
on to the airport it
well tell me this is
that would be really awful it
question and answer period just
because you don't know it
for in the red wine and back to a boil do
i'll turn the radio on in
they say you're not call on this line is
that's the way i feel it
what happens to get us to this point in
some has said there was no collision in
it was a great deal speaking with the a
i had the opposite it
we sit around and eat parking lot
i don't have boys but
that would have been best time to go to
if they didn't have to just
that's certainly true a
you tell me your attention to
we have that here too
usually busy fighting for survival just
i've had so many people do
i don't even get to see half my paycheck
we put some papers on the floor but
that's the closest thing the
kind of funny actually it
it was was the park i guess so
pop up trailer just
you're with the home office now so
they seem to be economically driven also
that be a really good thing to do
too much business just
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program a
even though they're so close to
doing his money is
i had never seen anything
this week people started a
used to be six bucks it
i caught a group of
i feel so silly just
are they all here in the area so
i kind of look at it this way it
public marketing is
sewing and quilting just
good to hear from you just
there is a city just
i read a lot and and i know people do
did you pull them just
that would make me happy so i
it's nice to get out in the open air a
i think it would do something for it to
it has really been nice here in
it's the rent dollars
it works out real nice just a
we've had lot of them in the past it
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it
it's depressing to it
i don't own my home just a
i've always wondered how he gets around a
it's just tough
fiction books that i really like it
you got any more of a
i'm beginning to think it's not just
that's something i miss quite a bit too
they finally came up with evidence it
that's true i didn't think about that a
good together as a team is a
part of it would probably work out just
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to sell it
i'm kind of a car buff myself a
buying of our fish
sometimes it will stop it
i just don't like that it's a
usually waiting to talk about it
i am close to return my bachelor's degree just
everything to enjoy it
he made a real big take himself in
they're actually great for them in a
it was for a murder trial it
are you a professional musician in a
it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program in
two sets of grandparents is a
i call and find out
you want salary too but what is it
i've heard about him in a
we've had more freezing this winter
if you can't get a handle on that just
they would fit for she's just a
they were okay
to find a band
on a working time it
after we had them for several years a
if they work at it a little bit a
we don't have enough
what are you making it
absolutely nothing in
i had a carpet service call up three times a
although he's probably better than a lot of them
just about any kind of music is
we like mexican food a
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times a
you've got to find an even line on
i think he really makes it a
where you got the buy a
it all starts to become similar to
i could go along with that a
it's like one second of recording a
that's a big thing with me the
i'm the only one in
i've been following through on that a
if there starts to be a lot of violence all
walking seems to be the best a
i don't think too many of them are anymore in
how do you feel about your game just
when i lived out in the country
i'm originally from maine it
to grow up and to do what they want to do it
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends just
i've worked in hotels just
they can pretty much get everybody there so
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it a
the air force is so much a
i don't have a lot of time so
i know they will go
sometimes they're not way home just
we're sort the bottom to
i make a lot of my christmas presents it
we were talking about that just the other day and
in the houston area it
i'm not counting on it
i like to have somebody come with me to
was always kind of tough to
not sure that's something i want to do it
most of the stores will accept those too
that is pretty unusual in
that's what he grew up listening to it
she'll be two in july it
i just that just been any money
the news or something in
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
he has showed a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing too
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm getting from that it
from where are your think in about four hours a
what's going to happen
i only weigh sixteen way too
horrible stuff like that is
an opera or the symphony or something to
if they don't have any lifting else to
i watched the news on it for a
worker of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to compare it to it
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was better than a
i want them to come back up next year
does that when i was a kid
things that are under state recession
i was an administrator a
i don't have a lot of time to do it a
and i'm up here just
i enjoy them coming to
but it is a pretty low crime rate in a
big closet space a
you're welcome to go some place else
i would prefer a
we do a lot of things on the weekends together
i've heard different so
we'd have to build less prisons and
not raining
well we just started a
we started taking her a
my mother and i were a
we are so busy so
i'd like to go bird hunting in
sometimes you have to ask them for that it
then do it all over again so
what do you think are some current trends in
about a thousand bad checks just
do you watch star trek a
so you don't have to put it down a
i don't see much t v mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and stay in
i don't get too many of those in
did they do that before he went in or what
i'm getting rid of this car just
i have three cats and a dog a
they don't need that seven day waiting period it
of course it's real convenient so
my husband and i both went in
you learn more about the characters and stuff just
just a little shell to go on a shirt
then we put our receipts in there in
where is it going to be so
fifty nine kilometers per gallon it
they did it early a
it shouldn't be decide so
