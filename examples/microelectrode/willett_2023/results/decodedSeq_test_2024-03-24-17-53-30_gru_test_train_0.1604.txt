there's so much going on here
the victim's family and things
playing one of these late in life mothers
the drug dealers

the next morning you want to take them out
if the news we're getting is any good
if something goes wrong
i haven't seen any
how to see each other all through the house
you don't worry about them too much
that kind of gas mileage
it really doesn't make any difference
i was born in texas and i read other years
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers
i guess i haven't had that much experience
reports and paper and that sort of thing
spending money that does not belong to them
does it have to be a special color
that's the freedom of choice
i didn't know too much about it
my son plays football
see how the family liked it
one in college always
we're his civil rights violated
it looks like it would be
doing country by hand and that kind of thing
i don't want top in my line
we can keep that out of our minds
from for his country business
we are doing that here as well
that's what made me happy
it depends on the person
i don't make that much
it's been a long time

his voice was really ground out by the kids
i didn't know it
that was a great little car
over a very long period of time
going investigating
the presence of companies
i wasn't opposed to paying for it
to upholster chairs
they are lovely
we see more and more women being involved
i have to make this one last as long as i can
only to the airport
well tell me this
that would be really awful
question and answer period
because you don't know

what happened to get us to this point
trump has said there was no collusion
it was a great deal spring with their
i had the opposite
we sit around and eat parking
i don't have boys
that would have been best time to go
if they didn't have to
that's certainly true
who's eleven or a mention
we have that here
usually busy fighting for survival
i've had so many people
i don't even get to see have my project
we put some papers on the floor
that's the closest thing
kind of funny actually
it was was the park i guess
a pop up trailer

they seem to be economically driven also
that would be a really good thing to do
too much business
he's retired now
i heard this on a christian program
even though they're too close
owning his money
i had never seen anything
this week people started
used to be six bucks
i caught a cop

i kind of look at it this way
public marketing
sewing and quilting
good to hear from you
they're oklahoma city
i read a lot and and i know people
did you pull them
that would make me happy so
it's nice to get out in the open here
i think it would do something for it
it has really been nice here
it's though when colleges
it worked out real nice
we've had lot of them in the past
it's only been that way in the last five years
i left right in the middle of it
it's depressing to
i don't own my home
i've always wondered how he gets around
it's just stuff
fiction books that i really like
you got any more
i'm beginning to think it's not
that's something i miss quite a bit
they finally came up with evidence
that's true i didn't think about that
good together as a team
part of it would probably work out
it's necessarily going to involve more taxes
it's just going to follow
i'm kind of a car buff myself
buying of a face
sometimes it will skip
i just don't like that
social training to talk about
i mean close to even my english degree
everything to enjoy
he made a real big take himself
they actual rate for them
it was for a murder trial

it's far beyond me
we've been an awful lot from the space program
two sets of grandparents

you want salary too but right
i've heard about him
you've had more freezing this winter
if we can't get a handle on that
they would vote for cheese
they were okay
to find a button
on a working time
after we had them for several years
if they work at it a little bit
we don't have enough
what are you making
absolutely nothing
i had a carpet service call up their time
although he's probably been on a lot of them
just about any kind of music
we like mexican food
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
i found it a lot of times
you've got to find an even line
i think he barely makes it
where you get the pie
it all starts to become similar
i could go along with that
it's like one second of recording
that's a big thing with me
i'm the only one
i've been following through on that
if there starts to be a lot of violence
walking seems to be the best
i don't think too many of them are anymore
how do you feel about your game
when i live out in the country
i'm originally from me
to grow up and to decide what they want to do
we just keep track of it on paper
i had friends
i've work in hotel
they can pretty much get everybody there
you can just say i'm sorry
the engine blew up in it
the some cases it so much
i don't have a lot of time
i know they will
sometimes they're not very home
we're sort the bottom
i make a lot of my christmas presents
we were talking about that just the other day
in the houston area
i'm not gardening on it
i like to have somebody come with me
was also kind of tough
not sure that's something i want to do
most of the stores will accept those
that is pretty unusual
that's what he grew up listening to
she'll be two in july
i just get it been any money
the news or something
i do have my radio going most of the day though
a girl and a boy
we have used a lot
it's a little bit financial type thing
an economic incentive for people to vote
i'm guess from that
some for a year think in about four i
what's going to happen
i only way chicken way
horrible stuff like that
an opera or the symphony or something
if they don't have any living relatives
i watched the news on it
i figured of the rap songs of the eighties
i do not have much to compare it to
i don't read as much as i would like to either
this was fresher then
i want them to come back up next year

things that are under state recession
i was an item editor

well we just started
we started taking her
my mother and i were

then do it all over again
what do you think are some current trends
about a thousand bad checks
do you watch star trek
now you don't have to put it down
i don't see much v mostly when i'm in school
they could probably come in and say
i don't get too many of those
did they do that be he went in or right
i'm getting rid of this car
i have three cats and a dog
they don't need that seven day waiting period
of course it's real convenient
my husband and i both went
you learn more about the actors and stuff
just a little shell to go in a suit
then we put our receipts in there
where is it going to be
fifty nine kilometers for killing
they need it early
it shouldn't be destroyed
sample service to come
which which i thought was a real anything question
well that's about it really
if i don't have a reel with a button on it
you get a lot of sunfish
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas
i guess i'm partial to big tree country
they are both remarried
the high school i went to
you have to think grandchildren
you could do it
he was treated like all the rest of students
i don't think her anymore
that's just not enough for a total
one thing led to another
two different parts of the country
i didn't have any top minutes to pick up
it really hit those people
put a cramp in your viewing
it's a pretty good size church
camping for years in a motor home
if you've only got a token force there
this time of the year
i'd just as soon a lot very people did
they think it's kind of cool
crime is too much
i don't know how my father did it
live on a farm for sixty years
i look at something as a job all
really kind of gone the rounds
i never even knew that
curling and guess
the commercial districts
what's the difference there
i like that kind of stuff
we might as well
savings and loan
they plastered over as well
all class white grapes
the time development
on the outskirts of houston
i forget how she got it
your vacation reimbursement
getting big sets for the prostate
if you have any doubt whatsoever
literary movies
i can't remember he
